<p>The point of discussing these processes in public or <em>opening the kimono</em> with the full journal of shaping my conscious thought is err on the side of being more open, more transparent ... so that others can avoid the mistakes I have made or even learn from the mistakes that I am making ... knowledge is entirely about feedback loops, testing hypotheses and developing a point-of view ... for the most part, AI is only a tool to help with keeping track of the threads or generating hundreds of things to provoke contemplation.</p>
<p>Simply following the crowd, acquiring toys to compare one's pile of toys with the best of the toy acquirers is much like PASSIVELY consuming content OR being a mere spectator OR being nothing but tourist following the crowd of tourists ... that kind of activity is fine, but it is not actually about <strong>being alive</strong> -- the ACTIVE conscious life is primarily a matter of CONSCIOUS CONTEMPLATION.</p>
<h1 id="preamble"><a class="header" href="#preamble">Preamble</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gratitude as Foundation.</strong> Gratitude is the most essential practice of human existence. I have lived a spectacular life—not through my own efforts, nor through the efforts of my family, but through pure blessing. No human being earns a spectacular life; we receive it. The awareness that I cannot possibly be grateful enough is itself the greatest gift. I am simply, flat-out LUCKY, and I am not alone in this blessing. Human beings, individually and collectively, take far too much for granted and fail to live lives saturated with gratitude and appreciation for the blessings all around us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Created as Originals.</strong> We are created to be <em>originals</em>, not duplicates or copies of others. This does not mean we should fail to appreciate differences, but we must never worship other human beings. I was born with this blessing—it requires no discipline to acquire; it is purely good fortune. I have never found lasting satisfaction in copying anyone else, despite being surrounded by worthy examples. Each of us was created to be UNIQUELY ourselves. We are not made to imitate but to explore what we were designed to become. With profound humility, I acknowledge that discovering what "being me" truly means requires walking with the Lord. My path, therefore, is not about following any crowd, attending church out of obligation, or doing something merely because everyone else does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Material Emptiness.</strong> I find no meaning whatsoever in material things—very little when I was younger, and now, after bearing the burden of maintaining possessions, my desire for them is less than none. Soon I will be entirely free of these distractions. Being a minimalist does not mean I fail to appreciate food, shelter, or utilities—these are blessings to be grateful for. But I find no meaning in ownership or accumulation. Material things are a BURDEN: something I am obligated to care for, only rarely and fleetingly a blessing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Structural Over Personal.</strong> In social matters, I am a structuralist—focused not on myself but detached so as to attend to the <em>good of the order</em>. I detest concern for my feelings or another individual's feelings when it comes to relationships. I am apersonal; I detest ego-driven manipulations. I care about the structure of relationships rather than my feelings or individual interactions. This means personal relationships do not "stick" for me. Individual relationship dynamics have often proven to be distractions from my path. This includes professional colleagues, friends, and family. I do not mean that I do not love my family, but I have found that I must focus on the overall goal rather than worry about feelings. I must walk my own path, and the path with my Lord generally leaves little room for concern about whether family, friends, or colleagues <em>like</em> me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Creator's Infinitude.</strong> I see everything about our Universe as exponentially greater than everything humans are capable of. Moreover, I believe this one Universe—all that humans can begin to contemplate—is an infinitesimally small fraction of all the universes our Creator can create. Accordingly, my personal agenda is to minimize my footprint, to first do no harm, and to maintain gratitude and appreciation for all blessings received. The proof of the Creator's existence is entirely ontological and philosophical. My only doubt concerns the anthropomorphic conception of the Creator—no human being can begin to understand the Creator or His many mansions. The anthropocentric language humans use to tell stories of God is driven entirely by human limitations. The weakness in contemplating the Creator's reality lies entirely in the limits of human consciousness, imagination, and expression. I use the traditional language of Christian tradition because nothing has shaped my consciousness more—but though the language is insufficient, it remains the best approximation of Reality available to me. I must respect the language of all my elders, even knowing with certainty that all elders are imperfect mortals doing their best, neither God nor anything like a supernatural god.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intentional Discovery Through Humility.</strong> Living intentionally is the process of discovering the Creator's will through prayer, contemplation, and above all, <strong>humility</strong>. Not only am I not God—though that acknowledgment must come first—I must also recognize that I do not truly know who I am, why I exist, or what should be important in my life. It is abundantly clear that other humans, and the mass of humanity in total, are either completely wrong or woefully misguided regarding life's purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submission as Blessing.</strong> Some see <strong>submission</strong> as a duty, when in reality it is the most profound, exquisite blessing—to be free of one's ego and actually able to walk with the Lord rather than chart one's own course. One must truly understand why the ability to meet one's most basic needs is so much better than the alternative of power, fame, fortune, and the need to feed one's ego. Finding the discipline to appreciate the ability to <strong>submit</strong> to the Lord is the most profound blessing any human can possess. The discipline of submission—rather than, or more correctly over and above, the discipline to impose one's will on one's surroundings—is the root of all freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detachment as Liberation.</strong> The discipline of aggressive <strong>detachment</strong>—overcoming attachment—allows one to experience the most sublime beauty and perfect peace of the eternities. To BE WITH GOD, to be in communion with one's Creator, requires a consciousness capable of releasing the burden of all things and all entanglements. This begins with forgiveness of others and oneself, but detachment builds upon that foundation. The ability to detach from all things, all relationships, all possessions, all desires is the root of spiritual freedom. Though I cannot know with certainty, it seems that one of the first and most necessary tasks of heaven is for every soul to love the Creator with infinite love, desiring nothing more than to spend eternities contemplating the perfection of detachment and the beauty of pure forgiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solitude and Emptiness.</strong> As fasting's importance lies not merely in self-control and appetite optimization but in the appreciation of fullness that can only be experienced from emptiness, most of the great gains in human experience arise from what comes after excesses are removed. When one is able to bask in <strong>solitude</strong> and ponder the essential core of what matters, true insight becomes possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>God Is Creative Love.</strong> The most creative, eternally unfolding love <strong>IS</strong> God—the definition of the word "God" means <strong>LOVE</strong>. The most divine form of love: "<em><strong>I AM</strong></em> becoming everything <em><strong>I AM</strong></em>"—Yahweh—LOVE of an eternal, self-existent, and unchanging nature. Beyond the human experience of growth, spiritual transformation, and fulfilling potential lies alignment with God's creative being, manifesting God's eternal character through developing selves, experiencing God's sufficiency and promises. There are scriptural echoes in Exodus 3:14-15, Malachi 3:6, Jeremiah 32:27, and other places—including our own lives. God IS, <em><strong>by definition</strong></em> and NOT BY ANYONE'S BELIEF, the most original, most profoundly creative LOVE. Genesis 1:1 opens Scripture with this operational DEFINITION of exactly what the word "God" means. We must BEGIN our understanding of God by contemplating the PUREST, truest, most eternal LOVE of eternal CREATION—the reason we were ever allowed to exist. God <strong>is</strong> LOVE—not a sappy human <em>likey</em> form of love, but a <em>love supreme</em>, in the parlance of Coltrane's saxophone: something beyond human expression, yet reflected in the most beautiful things humans have ever done. The greatest expression of CREATIVE love is the ability to <strong>trust</strong> completely in the Lord's plan for one's life—especially when one cannot be certain what that plan is. The way to exercise pure, true, creative love is to constantly seek first the purest, truest, most creative love of our CREATIVE Lord. Trusting in the Lord with all one's heart, might, mind, and being—never leaning on the crutch of simple, easy, false truths or giving in to the egotism of one's own understanding—is the root of all spiritual freedom. In all one's ways acknowledging Him, and He will make straight one's path to CREATIVE, eternal, everlasting joy.</p>

<p>What follows are 25 practical applications—ways to live out the principles articulated in the Preamble. Each represents a distinct pathway, a summarized practical purpose that flows from these foundational commitments.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-uniqueness-imperative"><a class="header" href="#1-the-uniqueness-imperative">1. The Uniqueness Imperative</a></h2>
<p><strong>I was not created to copy anyone else. I was created to be UNIQUELY me—but discovering what that means requires walking with the Lord, not following the crowd.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well."</em><br />
— <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-14.html"><strong>Psalm 139:14</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not really about copying anyone else; I was created to be UNIQUELY me, but I don't claim to know what being me really is. With the most profound humility, I must claim that I have to walk with the Lord in order to find my own unique way. Of course, this means that my path is not generally going to be about following any crowd, going to church or doing something simply because it is what everyone else is doing. David recognized that God's creative work in each person is distinct and purposeful. No two souls are identical, and no one else can fulfill the calling God has placed on my life. To copy others is to reject the unique masterpiece God intended me to be. The crowd offers safety in numbers but poverty of purpose. The path with God is often solitary, often misunderstood, but it is the only path that leads to becoming who I was truly made to be. <em>"I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made."</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="2-the-revelation-principle"><a class="header" href="#2-the-revelation-principle">2. The Revelation Principle</a></h2>
<p><strong>Meaning is not discovered by searching; it is SHOWN by the Lord. What gives life purpose is revealed, not invented.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you."</em><br />
— <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html"><strong>Jeremiah 1:5</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps wrong to say that I have <em>found</em> what gives my life meaning; primarily the things that give my life meaning have been SHOWN to me by the Lord rather than something I have found on my own. This distinction matters profoundly. The self-help industry promises that meaning can be manufactured through goal-setting, vision boards, and positive thinking. But genuine purpose is not a human construction—it is a divine revelation. God knew me before I existed. He consecrated me—set me apart—before my first breath. My task is not to invent meaning but to receive it, not to create purpose but to discover what was already embedded in my design. This posture of receptivity requires humility that the modern world finds almost incomprehensible. We are taught to seize, to achieve, to make our own way. But the soul formed for eternity can only find its purpose from the One who formed it. <em>"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you."</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="3-the-humble-uncertainty"><a class="header" href="#3-the-humble-uncertainty">3. The Humble Uncertainty</a></h2>
<p><strong>I don't claim to know what being me really is. Walking with the Lord is the only way to find my own unique way.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."</em><br />
— <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html"><strong>Proverbs 3:5-6</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the most profound humility, I must claim that I have to walk with the Lord in order to find my own unique way. This admission feels like weakness in a culture that celebrates self-knowledge and self-actualization. "Know thyself," the ancient philosophers commanded. But what if the self is too deep, too mysterious, too entangled with eternal purposes to be known apart from its Creator? I do not fully understand myself. I cannot see around the corners of my own soul. My understanding is limited by my finitude, distorted by my fallen nature, and insufficient for the task of navigating eternity. But the Lord sees. He knows. He guides. To lean on my own understanding is to trust a flickering candle in a vast darkness. To trust the Lord is to follow the One who <em>is</em> light. The paths He makes straight are not always the paths I would have chosen—but they are the paths that lead home. <em>"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding."</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="4-the-anti-conformity-calling"><a class="header" href="#4-the-anti-conformity-calling">4. The Anti-Conformity Calling</a></h2>
<p><strong>My path is not about following any crowd, going to church, or doing something simply because everyone else is doing it.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."</em><br />
— <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-10.html"><strong>Galatians 1:10</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My path is not generally going to be about following any crowd, going to church or doing something simply because it is what everyone else is doing. This sounds like rebellion, but it is actually the deepest form of obedience. Paul understood that serving Christ and pleasing people are often mutually exclusive pursuits. The crowd has its own logic, its own momentum, its own destinations—and they are rarely God's destinations. Even religious crowds can miss the mark. Church attendance, ritual observance, social conformity to Christian culture—none of these are substitutes for the solitary walk with God. The prophets were rarely popular. Jesus was crucified by consensus. The saints throughout history have often stood alone against the tides of their time. To follow God is to be willing to be misunderstood, marginalized, and out of step with the age. The approval of man is a cheap currency; the approval of God is the only treasure that endures. <em>"If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="5-the-material-emptiness"><a class="header" href="#5-the-material-emptiness">5. The Material Emptiness</a></h2>
<p><strong>I don't find ANY meaning whatsoever in material things—NONE. Being a minimalist means recognizing that ownership is a burden, not a blessing.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."</em><br />
— <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html"><strong>Matthew 6:19-20</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't find ANY meaning whatsoever in material things ... NONE. Being a minimalist does not mean that I don't need to eat or that I don't appreciate shelter or utilities—of course, these things are blessings to be grateful for—but I do not find any meaning whatsoever in ownership or from the things I have accumulated. Material things are a BURDEN to me, something that I am obligated to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing. Jesus was explicit: earthly treasures are temporary, vulnerable, and ultimately worthless as sources of meaning. Moths devour, rust corrodes, thieves steal. Every possession requires maintenance, storage, insurance, attention. The more you own, the more owns you. Minimalism is not an aesthetic preference or a lifestyle trend—it is a spiritual recognition that stuff cannot satisfy the soul. The pursuit of possessions is a detour from the pursuit of God. Those who find meaning in accumulation are building on sand. The only treasures worth laying up are those that transcend decay and theft—treasures stored in heaven, where neither moth nor rust can reach. <em>"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Being a minimalist does not mean that I don't need to eat or that I don't appreciate shelter or utilities—of course, these things are blessings to be grateful for. Paul's economy is radically different from the world's. In the world's economy, gain is measured in accumulation. In God's economy, gain is measured in godliness plus contentment. The equation is complete with food and clothing. Everything beyond basic provision is bonus, not necessity. We entered the world with nothing; we will exit with nothing. The interval between is an opportunity to pursue what matters—not the endless expansion of our material footprint. Contentment is not settling for less; it is recognizing that <em>more</em> is often <em>less</em> when it comes to spiritual vitality. The person who needs little is wealthy indeed, for their security rests not in barns and portfolios but in the God who provides daily bread. Gratitude for basic blessings is the foundation of contentment; contentment is the foundation of freedom. <em>"If we have food and clothing, with these we will be content."</em></p>

<p>Material things are a BURDEN to me, something that I am obligated to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing. Every possession demands attention. The house requires maintenance. The car needs repairs. The clothes must be washed, sorted, stored. The gadgets become obsolete and require replacement. Each item in our lives is a claim on our time, energy, and mental bandwidth. The heart follows the treasure—this is Jesus' diagnosis of the human condition. Where we invest our resources, there our attention fixates. Those who accumulate much find their hearts fragmented across a thousand possessions, a thousand concerns, a thousand anxieties about protection and preservation. But the person who travels light can fix their heart on a single treasure: the kingdom of God. Ownership feels like freedom but often functions as bondage. The minimalist discovers a paradox: in releasing the burden of things, the soul finds room to breathe, to pray, to attend to what actually matters. <em>"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."</em></p>

<p>I don't find much meaning in relationships either; most often, relationships have proven to be a distraction from my own path. This includes family relationships. This confession sounds harsh in a culture that idolizes family and friendship as the highest goods. But Jesus Himself made clear that following Him might require prioritizing the divine relationship over human ones. This is not about hating family—Scripture commands us to honor parents and love one another. It is about ordering loves correctly. When human relationships compete with the call of God, when family expectations conflict with divine purpose, when social bonds would pull us from the narrow path, we must choose. The person called to a solitary walk with God may find that many relationships, however precious, function as distractions from their unique calling. This is not a universal prescription—many are called to deep community. But for some, the path requires a certain holy solitude that others cannot understand or enter. <em>"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me."</em></p>

<p>I do not mean that I don't love my family, but I have found that I must walk my own path, and the path with my Lord generally does not include my family. Jesus' language here is deliberately shocking—"hate" in the Semitic idiom means to love less by comparison. The point is not emotional rejection but hierarchical ordering. God must come first, and "first" means that everything else—including the most sacred human bonds—must take second place. Some are called to serve God <em>through</em> family; others are called to serve God <em>despite</em> family resistance or incomprehension. The monastic tradition understood this: sometimes following Christ requires leaving behind even good things for the sake of the one necessary thing. This is not abandonment but properly ordered love. I can love my family truly while recognizing that my deepest walk is one they cannot share. The path with the Lord is ultimately solitary—no one else can walk it for me, and not everyone can walk it with me. <em>"He cannot be my disciple."</em></p>

<p>I have STARTED trying to write it of course ... working out the ideas and themes of one's obituary is basically what life is. The obituary cannot be finished because the life is not finished. Each day adds new lines to the story, new chapters to the narrative that only God can see in full. Paul calls us God's "workmanship"—the Greek word is <em>poiema</em>, from which we get "poem." We are God's poem, His artistic creation, shaped for purposes He determined before we drew breath. The good works were prepared beforehand; our task is to walk in them, to discover them day by day, to live into the meaning that was always there waiting. The obituary will one day be complete—but not by my hand. The final draft belongs to the One who began the work and will bring it to completion. Until then, I live in the tension of the unfinished, the not-yet-revealed, the still-being-written. Life is the working out; death is the final punctuation.

<p>Gratitude is perhaps the most important thing a human being can do. I have lived a spectacular life—not through my efforts or even through those of my family—but through pure blessing. No human being truly <em>earns</em> a spectacular life; we receive it. The awareness that I cannot possibly be grateful enough is itself a gift of grace. I am simply, flat-out LUCKY, and countless others share in this unearned fortune. Yet humanity, individually and collectively, takes far too much for granted. We fail to live lives saturated with thanksgiving and appreciation for the blessings that surround us at every moment. The practice of gratitude is not mere positive thinking; it is the recognition that all we have comes from a Source beyond ourselves. To live ungratefully is to live a lie. To give thanks in all circumstances—even suffering—is to align oneself with reality. <em>"Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."</em></p>

<p>My better life is NOT through my efforts or even the efforts of my parents or grandparents and family—in fact, I don't really see that ANY human has earned a spectacular life. Everything good in life is a gift. Every breath, every relationship, every moment of beauty or joy descends from the Father of lights. There is no self-made man in God's economy. Those who believe they have created their own success have simply failed to trace the chain of causation far enough back. The DNA that gave us capacity, the circumstances that provided opportunity, the thousand invisible hands that guided us away from disaster—none of these were self-generated. To recognize this is not to diminish effort or responsibility. It is to situate human striving within a larger context of grace. We plant and water; God gives the growth. This awareness obliterates pride while amplifying gratitude. Every good gift comes from above—where there is no shadow, no variation, no caprice, only generous, constant giving. <em>"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above."</em></p>

<p>I see everything about our Universe as being exponentially greater than everything that humans are capable of. Moreover, I believe that this one Universe—or everything that humans can begin to contemplate—is an infinitesimally small fraction of all the universes that our Creator can create. This cosmological humility shatters the anthropocentric illusion that humans occupy the center of reality. We are peripheral beings in a reality whose center is God alone. The gap between divine and human understanding is not merely quantitative but qualitative—infinite, unbridgeable from our side. This is not cause for despair but for wonder. The God whose thoughts exceed ours as the heavens exceed the earth is the God who condescends to walk with us. The incomprehensibility of God is not a barrier to relationship; it is the foundation for awe. Those who think they have God figured out have merely constructed an idol small enough to fit in their minds.

<p>The anthropocentric language that humans use to tell stories of God is entirely driven by human limitations. The weakness or inability to contemplate the reality of the Creator is entirely about the limits of human consciousness and the limits of human imagination and what humans are capable of expressing. I use the traditional language of the Christian traditions because those traditions have done more to shape my consciousness than anything else—so although the language is insufficient, it is still the very best approximation of Reality that I can possibly have. We must respect the language of all our elders, even though we know with certainty that all these elders are imperfect mortals doing their best. Every human word about God is a finger pointing at the moon—necessary for direction, useless if mistaken for the destination. Theology is always a stammering attempt to speak the unspeakable. We see in a mirror dimly; full clarity awaits eternity. Until then, we use the words we have been given, holding them humbly, knowing they are vessels insufficient to contain what they carry. <em>"Now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face."</em></p>

<p>The process of living intentionally is the process of discovering the Creator's will through prayer, contemplation, and above all humility. This is not the kind of planning the world admires—strategic goals, five-year plans, self-directed destiny. Divine guidance comes through receptivity, not assertion. Prayer is not informing God of our preferences; it is positioning ourselves to hear His. Contemplation is not naval-gazing but attentiveness to the One who speaks in silence. And humility—humility is the prerequisite for all the rest. Only the humble can receive; the proud are too full of themselves. The discovery of God's will is a lifelong process because God reveals progressively, step by step, as much as we can bear, as much as we are ready for. The path unfolds one step at a time to those willing to ask, to listen, to follow. <em>"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously."</em></p>

<p>Not only am I not God, although that must come first—I must also acknowledge that I don't even really know who I am, why I should exist, or what should be important in my life. This confession scandalizes modernity. We are supposed to know ourselves, define ourselves, create ourselves. But honest introspection reveals depths beyond our plumbing. Why do I exist? What should matter most? These questions have no self-generated answers. The soul cannot lift itself by its own bootstraps. Only the One who created me knows the blueprint, the purpose, the destination. David marveled at knowledge too wonderful, too high to attain—the knowledge of what God was doing in his innermost being. This is not despair but wonder. The mystery of the self is doorway to the mystery of God. Self-knowledge comes not from introspection alone but from divine revelation.

<p>Some will see submission as a duty, when in reality it is the most profound, exquisite blessing—to be free of one's ego and actually able to walk with the Lord rather than charting my own course. The world hears "submission" and thinks "oppression." But Jesus offers a yoke that brings rest, a burden that is light. The freedom the world offers—autonomy, self-determination, being your own god—is exhausting. It requires carrying the weight of an entire universe on shoulders never designed for it. Submission to God is not the end of freedom but its beginning. It is the freedom of a fish in water rather than a fish flopping on the dock claiming independence. The discipline to submit is harder than the discipline to dominate—and infinitely more liberating. Those who have tasted this blessing never return to the slavery they once called freedom. <em>"You will find rest for your souls."</em></p>

<p>One must truly understand why the ability to pay one's bills for one's most basic needs is so much better than the alternative of power, fame, fortune, and the need to feed one's ego. The world cannot fathom this arithmetic. How can less be more? How can obscurity be preferable to fame? How can modest provision surpass great wealth? The answer lies in what comes with the package. Great treasure brings great trouble—anxiety about preservation, envy from others, the corruption of the soul by what it possesses. But a little with the fear of the Lord brings peace that transcends circumstances. The person who needs little has little to lose. The person content with basic provision has already arrived where the wealthy are still striving to reach. Ego is an expensive addiction; simplicity is liberation. The discipline of littleness is the narrow gate to the spacious place. <em>"Better is a little with the fear of the Lord."</em></p>

<p>The discipline of aggressive detachment over and above overcoming attachment allows one to experience the most sublime beauty and perfect peace of the eternities. Detachment is not indifference; it is freedom. It is the ability to hold all things with open hands rather than grasping fingers. The person attached to possessions suffers with every loss; the detached person possesses everything because nothing possesses them. Jesus promises a paradoxical arithmetic: those who leave behind receive a hundredfold. This is not transactional but transformative. When the soul releases its grip on lesser goods, it becomes capable of receiving the greater. The letting go is painful—it feels like death—but it is the death that leads to life. Detachment from things, relationships, outcomes, even from one's own identity as the world defines it, opens space for God to fill.

<p>In order to BE WITH GOD, to BE in communion with one's Creator requires a consciousness that is capable of releasing the burden of all things and all entanglements. Martha busied herself with many things; Mary sat at Jesus' feet. Both responses seem legitimate, but Jesus commended Mary. The good portion is not doing but being—being with, being present, being available. Our busyness, however productive, can be a barrier to communion. Our entanglements, however worthy, can crowd out the One Thing Necessary. Communion with God requires what the mystics called "holy leisure"—not laziness but availability, not passivity but receptivity. The consciousness cluttered with concerns cannot perceive the still, small voice. The soul tangled in a thousand threads cannot follow the single thread that leads to God.

</blockquote>
<p>This, of course, begins with forgiveness of others and oneself, but detachment builds upon that. Unforgiveness is the heaviest chain—it binds us to the one who wronged us more surely than any physical bond. The one who refuses to forgive carries the offender everywhere, reliving the injury, nursing the wound. Forgiveness severs this chain. It releases the other and releases the self. But forgiveness is only the foundation; detachment builds higher. We must forgive not only persons but outcomes, not only wrongs but disappointments. We must release our grip on how we thought life should have gone, on what we thought we deserved, on who we thought we should have become. Each act of forgiveness and release removes another weight until the soul is light enough to ascend. The Father who forgives us empowers us to forgive. And in forgiving, we find we have been freed. <em>"If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>As with fasting's importance for not just self-control and appetite optimization and the appreciation of fullness of tastes and the senses that can be experienced only from emptiness, most of the big gains in the human experience arise out of what comes after the excesses are removed. The via negativa—the negative way—is the path of subtraction rather than addition. We are conditioned to think that more is better, that progress means acquisition. But the soul grows not by adding but by shedding. Fasting teaches this viscerally: hunger sharpens the senses, emptiness creates capacity for filling. The same principle applies to every domain. Remove the noise to hear the signal. Remove the clutter to see what matters. Remove the excess to make room for the essential. True fasting, Isaiah says, is not merely abstaining from food but loosing bonds, undoing yokes, setting free. It is the removal of everything that oppresses the soul.

<p>Most of the big gains in the human experience arise out of what comes after the excesses are removed and one is able to bask in solitude and able to ponder the essential core of what matters. Solitude is not loneliness; it is the soil in which insight grows. Jesus regularly withdrew from crowds, even from disciples, to be alone with the Father. In solitude, the clamor of competing voices fades. In silence, the still small voice becomes audible. The essential core of what matters cannot be discovered in noise and distraction. It requires the discipline of withdrawal, the courage to face oneself without entertainment or escape. In the secret place, with the door shut, the soul meets God unmediated. What happens there is invisible to the world but more real than anything the world can see. The Father who sees in secret rewards openly—but the reward is not what the world values.

God IS, by definition and NOT BY ANYONE'S BELIEF, the most original, most profoundly creative LOVE. This is not theological speculation but ontological definition. God does not merely have love as an attribute; God is love in His very being. All genuine love participates in and derives from this Source. The love that creates universes, that sustains existence moment by moment, that pursues the lost and redeems the broken—this is not sappy sentiment but fierce, creative, self-giving reality. John Coltrane's "A Love Supreme" gestures toward it; the greatest human art reflects a fraction of it. To know this Love is to know God; to miss this Love is to miss God entirely, regardless of theological correctness.

<p>The greatest expression of CREATIVE love is the ability to trust completely in the Lord's plan for one's life—especially when one cannot be sure of exactly what that plan is. This is the summit of faith: not trust based on certainty but trust extended into mystery. The Lord's plan rarely unfolds according to our blueprints. It takes turns we would not have chosen, includes losses we would have avoided, leads through valleys we would have gone around. Yet the path He makes straight is straight according to His geometry, not ours. To trust completely is to release the need to understand before obeying, to see before stepping, to know before believing. This kind of trust is not passive resignation but active love—love that believes the Beloved knows best even when appearances suggest otherwise. Acknowledging Him in all our ways means bringing every decision, every circumstance, every unknown into His presence and leaving it there. This is the creative love that corresponds to Creative Love. This is the trust that sets us free. <em>"Trust in the Lord with all your heart."</em></p>
