*Maybe you just want to start by reading some of the notes on my thinking captured in [the daily journal](Journal.md) of my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) processes.* 

The point of discussing these processes in public or *opening the kimono* with the full journal of shaping my conscious thought is err on the side of being more open, more transparent ... so that others can avoid the mistakes I have made or even learn from the mistakes that I am making ... knowledge is entirely about feedback loops, testing hypotheses and developing a point-of view ... for the most part, AI is only a tool to help with keeping track of the threads or generating hundreds of things to provoke contemplation. 

Simply following the crowd, acquiring toys to compare one's pile of toys with the best of the toy acquirers is much like PASSIVELY consuming content OR being a mere spectator OR being nothing but tourist following the crowd of tourists ... that kind of activity is fine, but it is not actually about **being alive** -- the ACTIVE conscious life is primariliy a matter of CONSCIOUS CONTEMPLATION.

# Preamble 

1) Gratitude is perhaps the most important thing that human can do. Maybe not everyone can be grateful, but I truly believe that I have had or made a better life for myself than anyone else. My better life is NOT through my efforts or even the efforts of my parents or grandparents and family -- in fact, I don't really see that ANY human has earned a spectacular life. I have experienced a spectacular life because I have been blessed by the awareness that I cannot possibly be grateful enough, ie I am just flat out LUCKY and I am not the only one so blessed! I am not really that impressed by human beings, either individuals or the totality of the human experience; in contrast, humans take far, far too much for granted and fail to adequately convey a life filled with gratitude coupled with appreciation of the blessings around us. **

2) We are created to be ***orignals*** rather than duplicates or copies of others. This does not mean that we should not appreciate the differences, but we should definitely not ever worship others. I was born with this blessing -- it's not a discipline that I had to work at; it's purely a matter of good fortune. It may take a while for others to discover why this is so important and I don't think I can be of any help in assisting with acquiring that understanding. Some things are things that one simply has. I have never found any real or lasting satisfaction in copying anyone else, in spite of the fact that I have been surrounded by fantastic examples that were very much worthy of imitation. As with each of us, I was created to be UNIQUELY me ... we are not created to copy, but explore what we were created to be.  Of course, I cannot begin to claim to know what *being me* really is ... with the most profound humility, I must claim that I have to walk with the Lord in order to find my own unique way. Of course, this means that my path is not generally going to be about following any crowd, going to church or doing something simply because it is what everyone else is doing.

3) I don't find ANY meaning whatsoever in material things ... very little when I was younger and now after being saddled with having to maintain material things, my desire for these things is less than NONE. Soon enough, I will be entirely free of these distractions. Being a minimalist does not mean that I don't need to eat or that I don't appreciate shelter or utilities ... of course, these things are blessings to be grateful for ... but I do not find any meaning whatsoever in ownership or from the things I have accumulated. Material things are a BURDEN to me, something that I am obligate to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing.

4) I am a structuralist or team member or tribalist when it comes to social matters, ie not focused on me, but instead detached so that one may be focused on the *good of the order* ... I DETEST ever worrying my feelings or some individual's feelings when it comes to relationships ... which means that I am APERSONAL, I detest ego-driven manipulations; instead care about the structure of relationships rather my feelings or individual interactions ... this means that personal relationshps don't really STICK for me. I just don't find much meaning in the individual interaction part relationships; most often, trying to figure out individual relationships has proven to be a distraction from my own path. This includes professional colleagues, friends, family relationships. I do not mean that I don't love my family, but I have found that I must try to make the overall goal, rather than worry about feelings AND I must walk my own path, and the path with my Lord generally does not include much time for worrying about whether my family, friends, colleagues *LIKE* me.

5) Of course, I see everything about our Universe as being exponentially greater than everything that humans are capable of. Moreover, I believe that this one Universe or everything that humans can begin to contemplate is an infinitestimally small fraction of all of the universes that our Creator can create. Accordingly, my personal agenda is to minimize my own footprint, to first do no harm, to have gratitude and appreciation for all of the blessings that we have recieved. The proof of the Creator's existence is entirely ontological or philosophical ... my only doubt is about the anthropogenic nature of the Creator ... the reality is that no human being can begin to understand the Creator or something like His many mansions ... the anthropocentric language that humans use to tell stories of God is entirely driven by human limitations ... the weakness or inability to contemplate the reality of the Creator is entirely about the limits of human consciousness and the limits of human imagination and what humans are capable of expressing ... I use the traditional language of the Christian traditions because those traditions have done more to shape my consciousness than anything else -- so although the language is insufficient, it is still the very best approximation of Reality that I can possibly have, ie I must respect the language of ALL of my elders, even though I KNOW WITH CERTAINTY that all of these elders are imperfect mortals doing their best, neither God nor even something like a supernatural god.

6) The process of living intentionally is the process of discovering the Creator's will through prayer, contemplation, and above all **humility**. It's not only am I not God, although that must come first -- I must also acknowledge that I don't even really know who I am, why I should exist, or what should be important in my life. It is abundantly clear that the other humans and the mass of humanity in total is really either completely wrong or woefully misguided as to what this purpose should be.

7) Some will see **submission** as a duty, when in reality it is the most profound, exquisite blessing to free of one's ego and actually able to walk with the Lord rather than charting my own course. In other words, one must truly understand why the ability to pay one's bills for one's most basic needs is so much better than the alternative of power, fame, fortune and the need to feed one's ego. Somehow finding the discipline necessary to appreciate the ability to **submit** to the Lord is the most profound blessing that any human can possibly have ... the discipline of submission, rather than or more correctly over and above the discipline to impose one's will over one's surroundings, is the root of all freedom. 

8) The discipline of aggressive **detachment** over and above overcoming attachment allows one to experience the most sublime beauty and perfect peace of the eternities. In order to BE WITH GOD, to BE in communion with one's Creator requires a consciousness that is capable of releasing the burden of all things and all entanglements -- this, of course, begins with forgiveness of others and oneself, but detachment builds upon that. The ability to detach from all things, all relationships, all possessions, all desires is the root of spiritual freedom. I cannot know of course, but it seems that one of the first and most necessary tasks of heaven is for every soul that will necessarily love the Creator with the most infinite love imaginable so that the soul desires nothing more than spend eternities contemplating the perfection of detachment and beauty of pure forgiveness.

9) As with fasting's importance for not just self-control and appetite optimization and the appreciation of fullness of tastes and the senses that can be experienced only from emptiness, most of the big gains in the human experience arise out of what comes after the excesses are removed and one is able to bask in **solitude** and able to ponder the essential core of what matters.

10) The most creative, eternally unfolding love **IS** God -- in other words, the definition of what the word "God" means IS **LOVE** ... the most divine form of love -- "***I AM*** becoming everything ***I AM***" Yahweh ... LOVE of an eternal, self-existent, and unchanging nature. Beyond the human experience of growth, spiritual transformation, and fulfilling potential ... aligning different journeys with God's creative being, manifesting God's eternal character through different developing selves, experiencing God's sufficiency and promises. Of course, there are scriptural echoes from Exodus 3:14-15, Malachi 3:6, Jeremiah 32:27 and other places, including even our lives. God IS, ***by definition*** and NOT BY ANYONE'S BELIEF, the most original, most profoundly creative LOVE. Genesis 1:1 kicks off scripture with this operational DEFINITION of exactly what the word "God" is about. We must BEGIN our understanding of God by thinking about the PUREST, most true, most eternal LOVE of eternal CREATION and the reason that we were ever allowed to exist is God.  God **is** LOVE ... not just a sappy human *likey* form of love, but a *love supreme* in the parlance of the notes from Coltrane's saxaphone, ie something that is beyond human expression, but yet some of the most beautiful things that humans have ever done are an inexpressible reflection of an attempt to express to this most profound creative LOVE. The greatest expression of CREATIVE love is the ability to **trust** completely in the Lord's plan for one's life ... especially when one cannot be sure of exactly what that plan is.  In other words, the way to exercise pure, true, creative love is to constantly seek first the purest, truest, most creative love of our CREATIVE Lord. Trusting in the Lord with all one's heart, might, mind and being and never leaning on the crutch of simple, easy, false truths or giving in to the egotism of one's own understanding is the root of all spiritual freedom. In all one's ways acknowledging Him and He will make straight one's path to CREATIVE, eternal, everlasting joy.

What follows are 100 alternative ways to refer to a pre-mortem reflection—or self-authored summary of one's life purpose, failures, values, and ongoing pursuits.

## 1. The Uniqueness Imperative

**I was not created to copy anyone else. I was created to be UNIQUELY me—but discovering what that means requires walking with the Lord, not following the crowd.**

> *"I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well."*  
> — [**Psalm 139:14**](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-14.html)

I am not really about copying anyone else; I was created to be UNIQUELY me, but I don't claim to know what being me really is. With the most profound humility, I must claim that I have to walk with the Lord in order to find my own unique way. Of course, this means that my path is not generally going to be about following any crowd, going to church or doing something simply because it is what everyone else is doing. David recognized that God's creative work in each person is distinct and purposeful. No two souls are identical, and no one else can fulfill the calling God has placed on my life. To copy others is to reject the unique masterpiece God intended me to be. The crowd offers safety in numbers but poverty of purpose. The path with God is often solitary, often misunderstood, but it is the only path that leads to becoming who I was truly made to be. *"I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made."*

---

## 2. The Revelation Principle

**Meaning is not discovered by searching; it is SHOWN by the Lord. What gives life purpose is revealed, not invented.**

> *"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you."*  
> — [**Jeremiah 1:5**](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html)

It is perhaps wrong to say that I have *found* what gives my life meaning; primarily the things that give my life meaning have been SHOWN to me by the Lord rather than something I have found on my own. This distinction matters profoundly. The self-help industry promises that meaning can be manufactured through goal-setting, vision boards, and positive thinking. But genuine purpose is not a human construction—it is a divine revelation. God knew me before I existed. He consecrated me—set me apart—before my first breath. My task is not to invent meaning but to receive it, not to create purpose but to discover what was already embedded in my design. This posture of receptivity requires humility that the modern world finds almost incomprehensible. We are taught to seize, to achieve, to make our own way. But the soul formed for eternity can only find its purpose from the One who formed it. *"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you."*

---

## 3. The Humble Uncertainty

**I don't claim to know what being me really is. Walking with the Lord is the only way to find my own unique way.**

> *"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."*  
> — [**Proverbs 3:5-6**](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html)

With the most profound humility, I must claim that I have to walk with the Lord in order to find my own unique way. This admission feels like weakness in a culture that celebrates self-knowledge and self-actualization. "Know thyself," the ancient philosophers commanded. But what if the self is too deep, too mysterious, too entangled with eternal purposes to be known apart from its Creator? I do not fully understand myself. I cannot see around the corners of my own soul. My understanding is limited by my finitude, distorted by my fallen nature, and insufficient for the task of navigating eternity. But the Lord sees. He knows. He guides. To lean on my own understanding is to trust a flickering candle in a vast darkness. To trust the Lord is to follow the One who *is* light. The paths He makes straight are not always the paths I would have chosen—but they are the paths that lead home. *"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding."*

---

## 4. The Anti-Conformity Calling

**My path is not about following any crowd, going to church, or doing something simply because everyone else is doing it.**

> *"For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."*  
> — [**Galatians 1:10**](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-10.html)

My path is not generally going to be about following any crowd, going to church or doing something simply because it is what everyone else is doing. This sounds like rebellion, but it is actually the deepest form of obedience. Paul understood that serving Christ and pleasing people are often mutually exclusive pursuits. The crowd has its own logic, its own momentum, its own destinations—and they are rarely God's destinations. Even religious crowds can miss the mark. Church attendance, ritual observance, social conformity to Christian culture—none of these are substitutes for the solitary walk with God. The prophets were rarely popular. Jesus was crucified by consensus. The saints throughout history have often stood alone against the tides of their time. To follow God is to be willing to be misunderstood, marginalized, and out of step with the age. The approval of man is a cheap currency; the approval of God is the only treasure that endures. *"If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."*

---

## 5. The Material Emptiness

**I don't find ANY meaning whatsoever in material things—NONE. Being a minimalist means recognizing that ownership is a burden, not a blessing.**

> *"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."*  
> — [**Matthew 6:19-20**](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html)

I don't find ANY meaning whatsoever in material things ... NONE. Being a minimalist does not mean that I don't need to eat or that I don't appreciate shelter or utilities—of course, these things are blessings to be grateful for—but I do not find any meaning whatsoever in ownership or from the things I have accumulated. Material things are a BURDEN to me, something that I am obligated to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing. Jesus was explicit: earthly treasures are temporary, vulnerable, and ultimately worthless as sources of meaning. Moths devour, rust corrodes, thieves steal. Every possession requires maintenance, storage, insurance, attention. The more you own, the more owns you. Minimalism is not an aesthetic preference or a lifestyle trend—it is a spiritual recognition that stuff cannot satisfy the soul. The pursuit of possessions is a detour from the pursuit of God. Those who find meaning in accumulation are building on sand. The only treasures worth laying up are those that transcend decay and theft—treasures stored in heaven, where neither moth nor rust can reach. *"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."*

---

## 6. The Contentment Economy

**Godliness with contentment is great gain. Food, clothing, shelter—these are blessings, not sources of meaning.**

> *"But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content."*  
> — [**1 Timothy 6:6-8**](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-6.html)

Being a minimalist does not mean that I don't need to eat or that I don't appreciate shelter or utilities—of course, these things are blessings to be grateful for. Paul's economy is radically different from the world's. In the world's economy, gain is measured in accumulation. In God's economy, gain is measured in godliness plus contentment. The equation is complete with food and clothing. Everything beyond basic provision is bonus, not necessity. We entered the world with nothing; we will exit with nothing. The interval between is an opportunity to pursue what matters—not the endless expansion of our material footprint. Contentment is not settling for less; it is recognizing that *more* is often *less* when it comes to spiritual vitality. The person who needs little is wealthy indeed, for their security rests not in barns and portfolios but in the God who provides daily bread. Gratitude for basic blessings is the foundation of contentment; contentment is the foundation of freedom. *"If we have food and clothing, with these we will be content."*

---

## 7. The Burden of Ownership

**Material things are a BURDEN—something I am obligated to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing.**

> *"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."*  
> — [**Luke 12:34**](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-34.html)

Material things are a BURDEN to me, something that I am obligated to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing. Every possession demands attention. The house requires maintenance. The car needs repairs. The clothes must be washed, sorted, stored. The gadgets become obsolete and require replacement. Each item in our lives is a claim on our time, energy, and mental bandwidth. The heart follows the treasure—this is Jesus' diagnosis of the human condition. Where we invest our resources, there our attention fixates. Those who accumulate much find their hearts fragmented across a thousand possessions, a thousand concerns, a thousand anxieties about protection and preservation. But the person who travels light can fix their heart on a single treasure: the kingdom of God. Ownership feels like freedom but often functions as bondage. The minimalist discovers a paradox: in releasing the burden of things, the soul finds room to breathe, to pray, to attend to what actually matters. *"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."*

---

## 8. The Relational Paradox

**I don't find much meaning in relationships either; most often, relationships have proven to be a distraction from my own path.**

> *"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."*  
> — [**Matthew 10:37**](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-37.html)

I don't find much meaning in relationships either; most often, relationships have proven to be a distraction from my own path. This includes family relationships. This confession sounds harsh in a culture that idolizes family and friendship as the highest goods. But Jesus Himself made clear that following Him might require prioritizing the divine relationship over human ones. This is not about hating family—Scripture commands us to honor parents and love one another. It is about ordering loves correctly. When human relationships compete with the call of God, when family expectations conflict with divine purpose, when social bonds would pull us from the narrow path, we must choose. The person called to a solitary walk with God may find that many relationships, however precious, function as distractions from their unique calling. This is not a universal prescription—many are called to deep community. But for some, the path requires a certain holy solitude that others cannot understand or enter. *"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me."*

---

## 9. The Solitary Path

**I must walk my own path, and the path with my Lord generally does not include my family. This is love properly ordered, not love abandoned.**

> *"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple."*  
> — [**Luke 14:26**](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/14/Luke-14-26.html)

I do not mean that I don't love my family, but I have found that I must walk my own path, and the path with my Lord generally does not include my family. Jesus' language here is deliberately shocking—"hate" in the Semitic idiom means to love less by comparison. The point is not emotional rejection but hierarchical ordering. God must come first, and "first" means that everything else—including the most sacred human bonds—must take second place. Some are called to serve God *through* family; others are called to serve God *despite* family resistance or incomprehension. The monastic tradition understood this: sometimes following Christ requires leaving behind even good things for the sake of the one necessary thing. This is not abandonment but properly ordered love. I can love my family truly while recognizing that my deepest walk is one they cannot share. The path with the Lord is ultimately solitary—no one else can walk it for me, and not everyone can walk it with me. *"He cannot be my disciple."*

---

## 10. The Unfinished Obituary

**My obituary is still in progress. Working out its ideas and themes is basically what life is—a continuous discovery of meaning revealed by the Lord.**

> *"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."*  
> — [**Ephesians 2:10**](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-10.html)

I have STARTED trying to write it of course ... working out the ideas and themes of one's obituary is basically what life is. The obituary cannot be finished because the life is not finished. Each day adds new lines to the story, new chapters to the narrative that only God can see in full. Paul calls us God's "workmanship"—the Greek word is *poiema*, from which we get "poem." We are God's poem, His artistic creation, shaped for purposes He determined before we drew breath. The good works were prepared beforehand; our task is to walk in them, to discover them day by day, to live into the meaning that was always there waiting. The obituary will one day be complete—but not by my hand. The final draft belongs to the One who began the work and will bring it to completion. Until then, I live in the tension of the unfinished, the not-yet-revealed, the still-being-written. Life is the working out; death is the final punctuation. Until that day, the pen remains in motion. *"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand."*

---

## Summary

*My obituary is still in progress because my life is still being written—not by my own hand, but by the Lord who knew me before I was formed and consecrated me before I was born.*

> *"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."*  
> — [**Proverbs 3:5-6**](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html)
