*Maybe you just want to start by reading some of the notes on our thinking captured in [the daily journal](Journal.md).* The point of opening the kimono with the full journal is err on the side  of being more open, more transparent ... so that others can avoid the mistakes or learn from the mistakes that I have made.

# Preamble 

**I believe that I have had or made a better life for myself than anyone else ... it's not through my efforts, in fact, I don't really see that ANY human has earned a spectacular life ... I have experienced a spectacular life because I have been blessed, ie I am just flat out LUCKY! I am not really that impressed by human beings, either individuals or the totality of the human experience ... in contrast, humans take far, far too much for granted and fail to adequately convey a life filled with gratitude coupled with appreciation of the blessings around us. Gratitude is perhaps the most important thing that human can do.**

As an exercise in gratitude journaling, I have STARTED trying to write an autobiographical journal which is something of a personal manifesto ... or maybe the pre-cursor to an obituary ... not in a actual formal document [other than this] but fundamentally it's more about just thinking, working out the ideas and themes of one's obituary is basically kind of what life is. My Life is defined by what I have found to give my life MEANING.

It is probably wrong to say that I have ***found*** these thing to be true ... I did not do the *finding* ... the things that give my life meaning have been SHOWN to me by the Lord rather than something I have found on my own ... my way of saying what I believe to be what the Lord has shown me is something like the following:

1) I have never found any satisfaction in copying anyone else, in spite of the fact that I have been surrounded by fantastic examples that were very much worthy of imitation. I was created to be UNIQUELY me, but I don't claim to know what being me really is ... with the most profound humility, I must claim that I have to walk with the Lord in order to find my own unique way. Of course, this means that my path is not generally going to be about following any crowd, going to church or doing something simply because it is what everyone else is doing.

2) I don't find ANY meaning whatsoever in material things ... NONE ... being a minimalist does not mean that I don't need to eat or that I don't appreciate shelter or utilities ... of course, these things are blessings to be grateful for ... but I do not find any meaning whatsoever in ownership or from the things I have accumulated. Material things are a BURDEN to me, something that I am obligate to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing.

3) I am a structuralist or team member or tribalist when it comes to social matters, ie not focused on me, but focused on the *good of the order* ...I DETEST ever worrying my feelings or some individual's feelings when it comes to relationships ... which means that I am APERSONAL, I detest ego-driven manipulations; instead care about the structure of relationships rather my feelings or individual interactions ... this means that personal relationshps don't really STICK for me. I just don't find much meaning in the individual interaction part relationships; most often, trying to figure out individual relationships has proven to be a distraction from my own path. This includes professional colleagues, friends, family relationships. I do not mean that I don't love my family, but I have found that I must try to make the overall goal, rather than worry about feelings AND I must walk my own path, and the path with my Lord generally does not include much time for worrying about whether my family, friends, colleagues *LIKE* me.

It would be silly or stupid for me to claim to have this worked out yet, even though I am now plenty old to have thought about it enough.  Of course, I MOST CERTAINTLY do not claim that anyone else should agree with my views about life for their life ... but these are the kinds of principles that I have found to ring true for me ... and I am trying to live it out as best I can.

OR "What would I tell my ten-year-old self about implementing a strategy for life?"

# My Obituary Is Still In Progress: It Is An Attempt to Sketch and Then Actualize 10 Principles for a Life Defined by Meaning

**I have STARTED trying to BE my obituary of course ... living out the ideas and themes of one's obituary is basically what life is.** My Life is defined by *what I have found* to give my life MEANING ... it is wrong to say that **I** have *found* this; primarily the things that give my life meaning have been SHOWN to me by the Lord rather than something I have found on my own. The process of living is the process of discovering—through:

- **Humility** — to admit I don't fully know who I am
- **Submission** — to walk with the Lord rather than charting my own course
- **Detachment** — to release the burden of things and entanglements
- **Solitude** — to hear the still, small voice above the noise of crowds

 

---

## 1. The Uniqueness Imperative

**I was not created to copy anyone else. I was created to be UNIQUELY me—but discovering what that means requires walking with the Lord, not following the crowd.**

> *"I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well."*  
> — [**Psalm 139:14**](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-14.html)

I am not really about copying anyone else; I was created to be UNIQUELY me, but I don't claim to know what being me really is. With the most profound humility, I must claim that I have to walk with the Lord in order to find my own unique way. Of course, this means that my path is not generally going to be about following any crowd, going to church or doing something simply because it is what everyone else is doing. David recognized that God's creative work in each person is distinct and purposeful. No two souls are identical, and no one else can fulfill the calling God has placed on my life. To copy others is to reject the unique masterpiece God intended me to be. The crowd offers safety in numbers but poverty of purpose. The path with God is often solitary, often misunderstood, but it is the only path that leads to becoming who I was truly made to be. *"I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made."*

---

## 2. The Revelation Principle

**Meaning is not discovered by searching; it is SHOWN by the Lord. What gives life purpose is revealed, not invented.**

> *"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you."*  
> — [**Jeremiah 1:5**](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/1/Jeremiah-1-5.html)

It is perhaps wrong to say that I have *found* what gives my life meaning; primarily the things that give my life meaning have been SHOWN to me by the Lord rather than something I have found on my own. This distinction matters profoundly. The self-help industry promises that meaning can be manufactured through goal-setting, vision boards, and positive thinking. But genuine purpose is not a human construction—it is a divine revelation. God knew me before I existed. He consecrated me—set me apart—before my first breath. My task is not to invent meaning but to receive it, not to create purpose but to discover what was already embedded in my design. This posture of receptivity requires humility that the modern world finds almost incomprehensible. We are taught to seize, to achieve, to make our own way. But the soul formed for eternity can only find its purpose from the One who formed it. *"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you."*

---

## 3. The Humble Uncertainty

**I don't claim to know what being me really is. Walking with the Lord is the only way to find my own unique way.**

> *"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."*  
> — [**Proverbs 3:5-6**](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html)

With the most profound humility, I must claim that I have to walk with the Lord in order to find my own unique way. This admission feels like weakness in a culture that celebrates self-knowledge and self-actualization. "Know thyself," the ancient philosophers commanded. But what if the self is too deep, too mysterious, too entangled with eternal purposes to be known apart from its Creator? I do not fully understand myself. I cannot see around the corners of my own soul. My understanding is limited by my finitude, distorted by my fallen nature, and insufficient for the task of navigating eternity. But the Lord sees. He knows. He guides. To lean on my own understanding is to trust a flickering candle in a vast darkness. To trust the Lord is to follow the One who *is* light. The paths He makes straight are not always the paths I would have chosen—but they are the paths that lead home. *"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding."*

---

## 4. The Anti-Conformity Calling

**My path is not about following any crowd, going to church, or doing something simply because everyone else is doing it.**

> *"For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."*  
> — [**Galatians 1:10**](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-10.html)

My path is not generally going to be about following any crowd, going to church or doing something simply because it is what everyone else is doing. This sounds like rebellion, but it is actually the deepest form of obedience. Paul understood that serving Christ and pleasing people are often mutually exclusive pursuits. The crowd has its own logic, its own momentum, its own destinations—and they are rarely God's destinations. Even religious crowds can miss the mark. Church attendance, ritual observance, social conformity to Christian culture—none of these are substitutes for the solitary walk with God. The prophets were rarely popular. Jesus was crucified by consensus. The saints throughout history have often stood alone against the tides of their time. To follow God is to be willing to be misunderstood, marginalized, and out of step with the age. The approval of man is a cheap currency; the approval of God is the only treasure that endures. *"If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."*

---

## 5. The Material Emptiness

**I don't find ANY meaning whatsoever in material things—NONE. Being a minimalist means recognizing that ownership is a burden, not a blessing.**

> *"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."*  
> — [**Matthew 6:19-20**](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html)

I don't find ANY meaning whatsoever in material things ... NONE. Being a minimalist does not mean that I don't need to eat or that I don't appreciate shelter or utilities—of course, these things are blessings to be grateful for—but I do not find any meaning whatsoever in ownership or from the things I have accumulated. Material things are a BURDEN to me, something that I am obligated to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing. Jesus was explicit: earthly treasures are temporary, vulnerable, and ultimately worthless as sources of meaning. Moths devour, rust corrodes, thieves steal. Every possession requires maintenance, storage, insurance, attention. The more you own, the more owns you. Minimalism is not an aesthetic preference or a lifestyle trend—it is a spiritual recognition that stuff cannot satisfy the soul. The pursuit of possessions is a detour from the pursuit of God. Those who find meaning in accumulation are building on sand. The only treasures worth laying up are those that transcend decay and theft—treasures stored in heaven, where neither moth nor rust can reach. *"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."*

---

## 6. The Contentment Economy

**Godliness with contentment is great gain. Food, clothing, shelter—these are blessings, not sources of meaning.**

> *"But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content."*  
> — [**1 Timothy 6:6-8**](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-6.html)

Being a minimalist does not mean that I don't need to eat or that I don't appreciate shelter or utilities—of course, these things are blessings to be grateful for. Paul's economy is radically different from the world's. In the world's economy, gain is measured in accumulation. In God's economy, gain is measured in godliness plus contentment. The equation is complete with food and clothing. Everything beyond basic provision is bonus, not necessity. We entered the world with nothing; we will exit with nothing. The interval between is an opportunity to pursue what matters—not the endless expansion of our material footprint. Contentment is not settling for less; it is recognizing that *more* is often *less* when it comes to spiritual vitality. The person who needs little is wealthy indeed, for their security rests not in barns and portfolios but in the God who provides daily bread. Gratitude for basic blessings is the foundation of contentment; contentment is the foundation of freedom. *"If we have food and clothing, with these we will be content."*

---

## 7. The Burden of Ownership

**Material things are a BURDEN—something I am obligated to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing.**

> *"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."*  
> — [**Luke 12:34**](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-34.html)

Material things are a BURDEN to me, something that I am obligated to take care of and only rarely a fleeting blessing. Every possession demands attention. The house requires maintenance. The car needs repairs. The clothes must be washed, sorted, stored. The gadgets become obsolete and require replacement. Each item in our lives is a claim on our time, energy, and mental bandwidth. The heart follows the treasure—this is Jesus' diagnosis of the human condition. Where we invest our resources, there our attention fixates. Those who accumulate much find their hearts fragmented across a thousand possessions, a thousand concerns, a thousand anxieties about protection and preservation. But the person who travels light can fix their heart on a single treasure: the kingdom of God. Ownership feels like freedom but often functions as bondage. The minimalist discovers a paradox: in releasing the burden of things, the soul finds room to breathe, to pray, to attend to what actually matters. *"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."*

---

## 8. The Relational Paradox

**I don't find much meaning in relationships either; most often, relationships have proven to be a distraction from my own path.**

> *"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."*  
> — [**Matthew 10:37**](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-37.html)

I don't find much meaning in relationships either; most often, relationships have proven to be a distraction from my own path. This includes family relationships. This confession sounds harsh in a culture that idolizes family and friendship as the highest goods. But Jesus Himself made clear that following Him might require prioritizing the divine relationship over human ones. This is not about hating family—Scripture commands us to honor parents and love one another. It is about ordering loves correctly. When human relationships compete with the call of God, when family expectations conflict with divine purpose, when social bonds would pull us from the narrow path, we must choose. The person called to a solitary walk with God may find that many relationships, however precious, function as distractions from their unique calling. This is not a universal prescription—many are called to deep community. But for some, the path requires a certain holy solitude that others cannot understand or enter. *"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me."*

---

## 9. The Solitary Path

**I must walk my own path, and the path with my Lord generally does not include my family. This is love properly ordered, not love abandoned.**

> *"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple."*  
> — [**Luke 14:26**](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/14/Luke-14-26.html)

I do not mean that I don't love my family, but I have found that I must walk my own path, and the path with my Lord generally does not include my family. Jesus' language here is deliberately shocking—"hate" in the Semitic idiom means to love less by comparison. The point is not emotional rejection but hierarchical ordering. God must come first, and "first" means that everything else—including the most sacred human bonds—must take second place. Some are called to serve God *through* family; others are called to serve God *despite* family resistance or incomprehension. The monastic tradition understood this: sometimes following Christ requires leaving behind even good things for the sake of the one necessary thing. This is not abandonment but properly ordered love. I can love my family truly while recognizing that my deepest walk is one they cannot share. The path with the Lord is ultimately solitary—no one else can walk it for me, and not everyone can walk it with me. *"He cannot be my disciple."*

---

## 10. The Unfinished Obituary

**My obituary is still in progress. Working out its ideas and themes is basically what life is—a continuous discovery of meaning revealed by the Lord.**

> *"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."*  
> — [**Ephesians 2:10**](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-10.html)

I have STARTED trying to write it of course ... working out the ideas and themes of one's obituary is basically what life is. The obituary cannot be finished because the life is not finished. Each day adds new lines to the story, new chapters to the narrative that only God can see in full. Paul calls us God's "workmanship"—the Greek word is *poiema*, from which we get "poem." We are God's poem, His artistic creation, shaped for purposes He determined before we drew breath. The good works were prepared beforehand; our task is to walk in them, to discover them day by day, to live into the meaning that was always there waiting. The obituary will one day be complete—but not by my hand. The final draft belongs to the One who began the work and will bring it to completion. Until then, I live in the tension of the unfinished, the not-yet-revealed, the still-being-written. Life is the working out; death is the final punctuation. Until that day, the pen remains in motion. *"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand."*

---

## Summary

*My obituary is still in progress because my life is still being written—not by my own hand, but by the Lord who knew me before I was formed and consecrated me before I was born.*

> *"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."*  
> — [**Proverbs 3:5-6**](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html)
