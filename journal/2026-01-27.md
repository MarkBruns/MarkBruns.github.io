# The Long Minnesota Political Heritage of the Common Man-Of-The-People Entering Politics, Then "Going Native" and Wield Power, So That He Makes Everything He Touches Turn To Shit 

On July 26, 1908, Attorney General Charles J. Bonaparte established a force of 34 special agents within the Department of Justice, marking the official birth of what would become the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This momentous development arose from an extraordinary political confrontation between President Theodore Roosevelt and James A. Tawney—a Minnesota congressman whose biography embodied the classic American story of the self-made man who rose from humble beginnings, only to become an entrenched defender of corruption and a pillar of the very political machine he might once have opposed.

Tawney's story illustrates a recurring pattern in American politics: the "common working man" who enters politics promising reform but instead "goes native," becoming an enabler of systemic corruption.

## The Blacksmith Who Became a Political Machine Boss

[James Albertus Tawney was born in 1855 near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he apprenticed with his father as a blacksmith and subsequently learned the machinist's trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Tawney). In 1877, he relocated to Winona, Minnesota, working as a blacksmith and machinist before studying law in his spare time—mornings and evenings for two years—and gaining admission to the bar in 1882.

This was precisely the kind of biography that appealed to voters: a man who knew hard work, who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps, who had labored with his hands before entering the law. [Tawney was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1890, then to Congress as a Republican in 1892, serving in nine consecutive Congresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Tawney).

[In 1897, Tawney was appointed the first Republican Whip by Speaker Thomas Reed to help keep track of the whereabouts of party Members, holding that position from 1899 to 1905](https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Republican-Whips/). By 1905, he had attained the powerful position of Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, controlling the federal purse strings.

## The Alliance with "Cannonism"

[Tawney became identified with "Cannonism," the autocratic system of party control developed under House Speaker Joseph G. Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Tawney). [Under Cannon's leadership, the system of autocratic party control of legislation in the House had been developed to a high point of effectiveness, with the Speaker's authority becoming in practice almost unrestricted](https://chroniclesofamerica.com/theodore-roosevelt/taft_administration.htm).

[For seven years Cannon had told the House what to do by means of a few terse epigrams and a set of rock-ribbed rules](https://time.com/archive/6655967/political-notes-cannonism/). This concentrated power in the hands of a few senior members who controlled committee assignments, dictated which bills reached the floor, and crushed dissent within Republican ranks.

Tawney, the former blacksmith from Minnesota, had become one of Cannon's most reliable lieutenants—a guardian of the old order rather than a champion of reform.

## The Western Land Fraud Epidemic

The corruption Tawney helped protect was staggering in scale. At the turn of the 20th century, massive land fraud rings were systematically looting the American West.

[Roosevelt was particularly concerned about conservation and fraudulent land deals being perpetrated by many people, including some members of Congress](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-birth-of-the-fbi-willard-m-oliver/1129993279). The schemes, usually devised by Congressmen were crafted with lobbying from wealthy interests to exploited provision of federal laws that were intended to encourage the economic expansion and survival of the United States. The general intent of the policy was originally about encouraging homesteading primarily to famines that were prevalent all over the world from ever being a factor in America. A secondary aim of the intent of these policies was to distribute land for Civil War soldiers [especially freed slaves who fought for the Union] and to reward others who had helped build the nation. In other words, the point of the land policy was supposed to be about generally facilitating economic expansion by increasing of farming, food processing, mining, construction and timber harvest and building transportation/telegraph networks. 

The policy philosophy intended to grow the American economy and distribute the wealth was subverted by horrendously corrupt Congressmen and their well-orchestrated schemes to cover up the massive fraud and deception by squelching all investigations into the massive fraud. 

### The Mechanics of Systematic Theft

**The "Dummy Entryman" System**: [Under the Timber and Stone Act, wealthy companies fraudulently circumvented the law by hiring individuals to purchase 160-acre lots that were then deeded to the company in direct violation of the law, with more than 90 percent of the several million acres of timberland privatized in Washington, Oregon, Nevada and California fraudulently acquired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_and_Stone_Act).

[Dummy entrymen would claim a homestead site, and once they had the title, they would transfer it to a lumberman for a small bribe of about $50](https://mchumor.com/yachats-history.com/camp-one-road.html).

**Fabricated Evidence**: [Entrymen had to swear they had built homes or improved the land, with cabins being the only improvement made on claims, though the entrymen hardly ever slept overnight there, even though they made final proof within 8 or 10 months alleging continuous residence](https://amerisurv.com/2025/10/25/the-rest-of-the-story-part-1/).

[Companies were ultimately able to obtain title on up to 100,000 acres through these fraudulent schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_and_Stone_Act).

## The Oregon Scandal: Congressional Corruption Exposed

[The Oregon Land Fraud Scandal involved most of Oregon's U.S. congressional delegation receiving indictments, including Senator John H. Mitchell and Representatives John N. Williamson and Binger Hermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_land_fraud_scandal).

### How Members of Congress Profited

Politicians weren't passive bystanders—they were essential partners in the theft:

[Senator Mitchell illegally used his position to aid clients in acquiring patents to fraudulent land claims, with his law partner and personal secretary both testifying against him](https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/land-fraud-trial-of-senator-john-mitchell/). [Mitchell was found guilty on July 3, 1905, and sentenced to six months in prison and a $1,000 fine, though he died before his appeal could be heard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_land_fraud_scandal).

[Binger Hermann served as both a Congressman and Commissioner of the General Land Office from March 1897 until February 1903](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binger_Hermann), and [before vacating his office after resigning, he destroyed thirty-five letterbooks](https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/hermann_binger_1843_1926_/)—a position that gave him extraordinary power to steer land acquisitions toward favored interests.

[Speculators filed fraudulent claims and bribed General Land Office officials to approve them, and by this means, great tracts of valuable timber and grazing land were stolen from the American public](https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/oregon_land_fraud_trials_1904_1910_/).

## Tawney's Blockade of Reform

When Roosevelt began investigating these frauds, he ran headlong into Tawney's opposition.

[Roosevelt was concerned about conservation and enforcement of fraudulent land deals, and when he began using the Secret Service to investigate these crimes, Congress blocked him from doing so](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-birth-of-the-fbi-willard-m-oliver/1129993279).

[Roosevelt had been borrowing Secret Service operatives to investigate massive land fraud rings in the West, and these investigations eventually implicated several members of Congress in criminal activities](https://www.fbi.gov/history/history-publications-reports/the-birth-of-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation).

### The Tawney Amendment: Protecting the Corrupt

[As Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Tawney was a vocal critic of the executive branch's use of Secret Service agents for non-Treasury investigations, and in retaliation to protect fellow legislators, Tawney's committee drafted an amendment to the Sundry Civil Appropriation Bill in 1908, explicitly prohibiting the Department of Justice from using borrowed Secret Service agents for criminal investigations](https://www.fbi.gov/history/history-publications-reports/the-birth-of-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation).

[Tawney attached an amendment to an appropriations bill that prevented the president from using Secret Service operatives to investigate land fraud](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/30/book-review-birth-fbi/).

[Taft made a speech at Winona, Minnesota, in support of Congressman James A. Tawney, the one Republican representative from Minnesota who had not voted against the Payne-Aldrich Tariff bill, with Taft declaring it "the best tariff bill that the Republican party has ever passed"](https://chroniclesofamerica.com/theodore-roosevelt/taft_administration.htm)—further cementing Tawney's reputation as a defender of established interests rather than a reformer.

## Roosevelt and Bonaparte Strike Back

[In a complicated political showdown involving what lawmakers charged was Roosevelt's grab for executive power, Congress banned the loan of Secret Service operatives to any federal department in May 1908](https://www.fbi.gov/history/brief-history).

Rather than accepting defeat, Roosevelt and his reform-minded Attorney General found a creative solution.

[Charles Joseph Bonaparte was an American lawyer and political activist of French noble descent who advocated for progressive and liberal causes, a descendant of the House of Bonaparte, with his grandfather being Jérôme Bonaparte, brother of Emperor Napoleon I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Bonaparte).

[Bonaparte was a most unlikely muckraker and civil libertarian given his wealthy, blue-blooded background, yet as a reformer and as Roosevelt's legal muscle he arguably had more impact on the American body politic than any other Roman Catholic layman of the day](https://magazine.nd.edu/stories/the-other-bonaparte/).

[In late June, Bonaparte quietly hired nine of the Secret Service investigators he had borrowed before and brought them together with another 25 of his own to form a special agent force, and on July 26, 1908, Bonaparte ordered Department of Justice attorneys to refer most investigative matters to his Chief Examiner, Stanley W. Finch, for handling by one of these 34 agents](https://www.fbi.gov/history/brief-history).

[Bonaparte's successor, Attorney General George W. Wickersham, gave this band of agents their first name on March 16, 1909—the Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/history/brief-history). This Bureau would be renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935.

## Tawney's Downfall: Reform Triumphant

[Tawney's attempt to shield Congress from investigation backfired, resulting in the establishment of a permanent, centralized federal detective force that Roosevelt and Bonaparte had long desired](https://www.fbi.gov/history/history-publications-reports/the-birth-of-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation).

But Tawney's troubles were only beginning. The Progressive insurgency that Roosevelt had championed was gaining strength across the country, and nowhere more than in Minnesota.

[In 1910 at age 29, Sydney Anderson defeated incumbent James Albertus Tawney in the Republican primary election with the support of Theodore Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot and other Progressive Republicans, running on a platform of drastically reduced tariffs and opposition to Cannonism with which Tawney was identified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Anderson).

[James A. Tawney wound up the hardest fight of his congressional career, with Theodore Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot, Francis J. Heney and other exponents of progressive republicanism campaigning against him](https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/348886143/).

[Nine-term Republican Congressman James A. Tawney became the third incumbent U.S. Representative to lose a primary in Minnesota, falling to attorney Sydney Anderson by 11.6 points](https://mn.electionarchives.lib.umn.edu/cycle/1910/).

The blacksmith who had risen to become one of Congress's most powerful figures was cast down by the very reform movement he had spent years obstructing.

## The Minnesota Pattern: Gullibility and Corruption

Tawney's career embodies a recurring pattern particularly evident in Minnesota and similar states: voters elect a "common man" with an appealing biography, believing he will clean up politics. Instead, the newcomer is absorbed into the existing power structure, becoming a defender of corruption rather than a reformer.

The gullibility lies in the persistent belief that humble origins automatically translate into honest governance—that a blacksmith-turned-lawyer will naturally fight for the common people rather than for the interests that finance campaigns and offer lucrative opportunities.

[The defeat of Cannonism put an end to the autocratic power of the Speaker and relegated him to the position of a mere presiding officer, and it had wider significance, for it portended the division in the old Republican party out of which was to come the new Progressive party](https://chroniclesofamerica.com/theodore-roosevelt/taft_administration.htm).

Tawney had fought on the wrong side of that divide. After his 1910 defeat, he served on the International Joint Commission dealing with boundary waters between the United States and Canada until his death in 1919.

## The Ironic Legacy

The episode reveals three profound ironies:

First, Tawney's attempt to block investigations of Congressional corruption inadvertently created the FBI—an institution that would investigate corruption at all levels of government for more than a century.

Second, the "common man" from Minnesota who voters trusted to represent their interests instead became a pillar of the political machine, using his power to protect corrupt colleagues and obstruct reform.

Third, it took another "common man"—the 29-year-old lawyer Sydney Anderson—backed by genuine reformers like Roosevelt, to finally dislodge Tawney from power.

The story serves as a cautionary tale about political gullibility: humble origins and compelling personal narratives are no guarantee of honest governance. Without vigilant skepticism, reform movements, and genuine accountability mechanisms—precisely the kind of checks and balances that Tawney spent his career obstructing—even the most promising candidates can "go native," becoming enablers of the very corruption they might once have opposed.

[Tawney's papers contain material on his disagreement with President Roosevelt regarding the secret service and his relationship with Speaker Joseph Cannon](https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/22708), documenting his role as a machine politician who blocked reform at every turn.

In the end, James A. Tawney's greatest legacy was entirely accidental: by trying to protect corrupt Congressmen from investigation, he forced the creation of America's premier federal law enforcement agency. It was reform by obstruction—a fitting epitaph for a man who spent eighteen years in Congress fighting against the very reforms that history would vindicate.
