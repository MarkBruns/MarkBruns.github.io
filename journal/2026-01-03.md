***MelonCave is about caving in the melons of those personal demons which drive the bad habits of being ourselves. Caving in these melons is an absolutely serious attack or war for our souls ... although we may defend them, rationalize them or try to ignore them, those personal demons aggressively hold us back and condemn our spiritual being.***

# Items To Ponder As Advice For My Younger Self

I had an inkling of these things, but I was unsure -- I didn't KNOW these things. What I wish I ***knew*** when I was fifteen:

1) TAKE GREATER responsibility for your own education, growth and aspirations. Respect them, but do NOT rely on teachers or coaches or even parents or relatives ... the BASICS of school are important for getting along in life, ie prep for standardized SAT/ACT tests and take example tests to understand shortcomings in BASIC math/chem/physics/scientific method OR BASIC reading/writing/information/knowledge ... standardized test of BASIC knowledge matter, but NOBODY else can do the WORK of self-awareness and taking responsibility for you education, growth and aspirations -- others just do not and cannot *KNOW* **you** like ***YOU MUST KNOW YOU*** ... become more self-aware, become more autodidactic ... *grow up faster to establish your independence and be ready to be your own parent -- to some degree, you probably have to be the parent for your parents ... so GROW UP!!!*

2) The person who learns the most, the broadest, the deepest in any classroom or seminar or workshop or training session is the person who is actually attempting to genuinely train and help improve the people in the class ... that's because the person who is training others has to prepare, organize, think through and understand the material at a much deeper level, from multiple perspectives, in order to be able how to best get the ideas across to others who learn from different perspectives, backgrounds, with different intentions. SOME of the people in the class, workshop, or coaching session will have something to add -- so it's important to be prepared in order to opportunistically use those people or different serindiptious situations that arise in order to INCLUDE others and incentivize them to contribute. WHEN you have the opportunity to teach others, TAKE IT! When you don't have those opportunities, create them with things like participating in Toastmasters or doing podcasts or volunteering to help teaching others.

3) The ONLY asset that you really possess in this life is your own TIME, ATTENTION and FOCUS ... humans BECOME what they spend their time and attention focusing on.It is NOT important to just stay busy; refuse to equate time management with having every fifteen minute time block in your 168 hour week scheduled, although it will be important at times to just get busy doing what you least want to do but know that you should do, ie if you ever bored and don't know what to do, do 8 sets of pull-ups, pushups, burpees, hitting/kicking the heavy bag, doing dead lifts or doing yoga/flexibility exercises -- read or write, but NEVER just watch television or movies.  It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to FOCUS your time, effort and intensity on the RIGHT things which you know are right because you have paid attention and thought about what truly matters. The ONLY asset that you really possess in this life is your own TIME, ATTENTION and FOCUS.

4) From any paycheck, including the assets that you cash in, be sure to INVEST more than you SPEND. How you invest is very important, but don't expect to get your investment back, even if you are buying T-bills ... DIVERSIFY, DIVERSIFY, DIVERSIFY ... but be sure to INVEST in things that are growing and have the potential to pay you back 100-fold or 1000-fold over the next 10-25 years. DO NOT speculate ... INVEST in things that have the solid potential to GROW by making people radically more productive, efficient, healthy, or much less needy, ie don't invest in things like Coca-cola or Disney or automobiles or anything that addicts people to comfort. GROWTH comes from empowering people to radically more productive, efficient, healthy, or much less needy. In order to be less needy yourself, you will need to consume less than anyone you know -- THAT is why from every paycheck, including the assets that you cash in, you must be sure to INVEST much more than you SPEND. Consuming less must be your superpower ... as a general rule,***AVOID people who consume more than they invest like the plague that they are.***

5) INVEST in your circle of **competent** colleagues and friends; understand their competence, as well as their strengths and weakness; understand their motivations, what they feel threatened by as well as blind spots they don't see; make yourself more competent and more worth knowing, even if they never find out about your competence, ie BE ***READY***! You learned how to make friends with the smartest, most capable kid in the room or on the playground when you were three years old -- so don't forget the lessons in networking that you learned on the playground or in Sunday School. Networking is more important than knowledge, skills, aptitudes, good looks ... but don't just network -- you have to INVEST in your network of the most important people in your surroundings or those from the outside affecting your surroundings, ie of course that includes your family members, friends, but that also means paying greater attention to your housekeeper in a hotel or waiter in a restaurant.  In some cases, you cannot or should not meet people around you -- but you MUST pay greater attention to them and notice all kinds of things about them. You can learn a lot from criminals, homeless people, developmentally disabled people, mentally ill people, addicts, prostitutes ... the IMPORTANT thing is be observant and pay attention to people around you ... ***VERY, VERY, VERY people are truly worth knowing or listening to***, but you cannot really sort out who is most important to focus on, UNLESS you can focus on observing people. Networking is more important than knowledge, skills, aptitudes, good looks ... but don't just network.

6) AVOID gossips and people who waste time worrying about their reputation or feeding their ego; gossips are even worst than a waste of your time. Gossips will drag you down to their disgusting level and make conscious of your reputation among gossips and the truly inconsequential people on Earth. Learn to PROSPECT for greater competence; SEEK OUT the people who make a difference and study them, rather than EVER worrying about what people think of you. Avoid actors, celebrities, trial lawyers and anyone whose profession is built on developing skill or competence in bearing false witness or somehow giving a performance that is about bending the truth or advocating for a misrepresentation of the truth. Avoid materialists and people who waste ANY time worrying about material wealth ... you cannot afford to be associated with people who are insecure about something as silly as wealth,reputation or humanities evaluation of their worth. The ONLY evaluation that you can be concerned with is your Creator's opinion of your merit.

7) AVOID partying and partiers! NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER partake in any sort of substance that partiers use to alter their consciousness, ie this is not just alcohol, marijuana, psychedelics, cocaine, methamphetamines, opioids, etc or any kind of activity like being spectator, gossip or person engaged in some sort of activity that makes you stupider or less worth knowing.  The ONLY kind ofsubstance that you should EVER use to alter your consciousness is something that highly capable people use, like CAFFEINE or a cup of coffee either socially or early in the morning ... and even then, use it sparingly and strategically.  The ONLY acceptable way to truly alter your consciousness is through prayer, meditation, fasting and intense physical exercise. If you want to wake up in the morning, do exercises ... if you want to focus during the day, go for a walk WITHOUT your phone headphones ... if you want to sleep better at night, tire yourself out during the day -- if you can't sleep at night, get up and WORK, but don't take a nap, so that you sleep at night.  The ONLY acceptable way to truly alter your consciousness is through prayer, meditation, fasting and intense physical exercise ... but AVOID partying and any form of partier! 

8) Be more GRATEFUL; make your religion into being all about gratitude and the adoration of the Source of all blessings in all existences in all universes. Let your worship be about sharing the LOVE that you have found through your gratitude discipline. Try different things to develop greater gratitude discipline such as daily writing, revising, rewriting in your gratitude journal. STOP WORRYING about what you will lose -- perfecting our lives is mostly about what is taken away, especially when what is taken from us is not something we would choose to remove.  It's not what you do or what you add -- it's mostly about what you take away. The most important thing we can do in life is to PERFECT our lives, to simplify and make ourselves more capable of serving ... perfecting our lives is about overcoming the bad habits of being ourselves.

9) The whole point of exercise is about improving your DISCIPLINE and self-awareness. Don't just EXERCISE more; exercise SMARTER with planning, intention, discipline. Discipline equals more freedom in all things. Don't just READ more or read faster, but develop better knowledge management systems and AI-assisted knowledge engineering discipline. Develop the discipline of FORGIVING and letting go of attachments unceasingly, so that you are able to PRAY more or pray without ceasing, without ever worrying about reptuation or other regrets or worries. You might MEDITATE more or practice breathwork discipline, so that you are able to pray without ceasing ... but the point of meditation is not to achieve enlightenment through just sitting -- meditation as a mental exercise has to be about the discipline of letting go. As a general rule, you should try to understand so that you might SERVE BETTER, not more or write bigger checks. LOVE better, when it's NEEDED -- not more, when your hugs or displays of affection are about you. Do the things that are tough to do and the kinds of things that nobody can possibly see. Do MORE of those things ... and do NOT just do them when you feel like it, or when you have time ... MAKE TIME for these things EVERY DAY; stop being busy or being seen as busy. The disciplines that matter are the things nobody sees -- that's why they are the most important things that you can do to perfect your life, to simplify and make yourself more capable of serving.

10)   MOST IMPORTANTLY ... never, ever, ever, ever forget Mark 8:36 "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"  Study books like "The Imitation of Christ" by Thomas a Kempis, with an aim toward writing your own version of what it means to be a better disciple of Christ.  Study the lives of saints like St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. Therese of Lisieux, St. Catherine of Siena, St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila ... and try to write your own version of what it means to be a better disciple of Christ, but NEVER stop asking the Lord to show you his will for your life ... ***NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER forget Mark 8:36 "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"***

---

Let the ONE question of Mark 8:36 echo through every decision, every investment, every moment of attention: *"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?"* 

**The rest is commentary and elaboration.**

### The Soul Outweighs the World

## I. The Accountant's Dream

*(sparse piano, walking bass)*

Man came to me last night in pinstripes,
said he'd run the numbers,
said he'd figured the whole thing out—
 
"I got the world in columns," he said,
"assets and liabilities,
the whole blessed inventory—
skyscrapers, oil fields, diamond mines,
stock certificates thick as bibles,
every coin that ever rang
on every marble counter
from here to Singapore."

I said, "Daddy-o, what's the sum?"

He pulled out a ledger
big as the moon,
ran his finger down the page
and stopped.

His face went white.

"There's a line item here," he whispered,
"I can't seem to balance.
Keeps showing up in red.
Keeps asking what I *traded*."

And the column was labeled *SOUL*
and the number was *EVERYTHING*
and the profit was *ZERO*
and the loss was *FOREVER*.

He woke up screaming.
So did I.

## II. The Pawnshop of Forever

*(muted trumpet, brushes on snare)*

Down on the corner of Eternity and Now
there's a little shop
with a sign that says:

**WE BUY SOULS**
*No Questions Asked*

And brother, the line goes around the block.

Cats trading their essence
for Cadillacs,
their infinity
for a weekend in Vegas,
their *forever*
for fifteen minutes
on somebody's television set.

The man behind the counter
wears a slick suit,
smiles like a salesman,
weighs each soul on a scale
that tips toward darkness.

"What'll you take for it?"
asks the kid with hungry eyes.

"What have you got?"

"A little fame. Some applause.
The corner office.
Her phone number.
The last laugh."

*Click.*
The transaction complete.
The receipt crumbles to ash.

And somewhere,
in a back room
with no windows,
the inventory grows,
and grows,
and grows.

---

## III. The Weight of Things

*(solo bass, silence between notes)*

I held the world once,
 
cupped it in my palms
like a marble,
felt its heft—
 
all the mountains and the monuments,
the gold reserves,
the standing armies,
the libraries and the lies,
the whole spinning jazz of civilization—
 
and I'm telling you, man,
 
it was *light*.

Light as a rumor.
Light as last year's promise.
Light as smoke from a dead man's last cigarette.

Then I held my soul—
 
just sat quiet with it
in a dark room
at three in the morning
when the masks come off
and you see what you really are—
 
and brother,
 
it was *heavy*.

Heavy as the first word of Genesis.
Heavy as the silence after the last amen.
Heavy as the question nobody wants to answer:
 
*What are you becoming?*

The world floated away like a balloon.
The soul stayed,
dense as a collapsed star,
pulling everything toward its center,
asking,
 
"What will you give for me?
What will you give
in exchange?"

---

## IV. The Hustler's Lament

*(minor key, slow drag)*

I was the sharpest cat on the block,
had the angles figured,
knew every shortcut
through the maze of getting ahead.

Played the game like it was gospel,
climbed the ladder
rung by rung by rung
till I could see the whole city
laid out like a feast.

And I ate, daddy.
I *ate*.

But somewhere between the appetizer
and the check,
I lost my appetite
for the only food that matters.

Somewhere between
the first deal and the last handshake
I traded in my birthright
for a bowl of momentary soup.

And now I sit here,
rich as Croesus,
empty as his tomb,
wondering why all the money in the world
can't buy back
the thing I sold
when I wasn't paying attention.

The prophet asked the question
two thousand years ago,
still hanging in the air
like smoke from sacred fire:

*What shall it profit you?*
*What shall it profit?*
*What?*

The profit margin on infinity
is not a number, man.
It's a *name*.
And I forgot it.

---

## V. God's Image in the Mirror

*(piano chords, sustained, like bells)*

They tell me I'm made of dust,
and to dust I shall return—
 
but *this dust thinks*.
This dust *dreams*.
This dust looks at the stars
and says *"I know you."*

This dust carries something
that weighs more than matter,
something forged in the fire
of the First Word,
pressed with the thumbprint
of the Eternal.

I'm not just assembled molecules, man.
I'm not just chemistry doing chemistry.
I'm a mirror
angled toward the infinite,
reflecting something
that doesn't die
when the glass breaks.

The world is beautiful, yes—
all that sky and water,
all that light on the leaves—
but the world doesn't *know* it's beautiful.

I do.

And that knowing,
that strange sweet terrible knowing,
is worth more
than all the beauty it beholds.

The soul sees.
The soul weighs.
The soul *chooses*.

And no scale in any market
in any kingdom that ever rose and fell
can measure
what that means.

---

## VI. The Irrevocable Transaction

*(bass clarinet, haunted)*

Here's the thing about souls, man:
 
They don't come with a return policy.

You can give back the keys to the kingdom,
hand over the crown,
walk away from the corner office
with your cardboard box of regrets—
 
but the soul,
once traded,
doesn't come back to the shelf.

The rabbis say
you could own the whole planet—
every inch of it stamped
with your name—
and still not have enough
to buy back
what you gave away
for the privilege of owning.

*Irrevocable.*

That's the word that echoes
in the dark cathedral of consequence.

The deal is done.
The ink is dry.
The signature stands.

Unless—

unless someone else
paid the price
that you could never pay,
bought you back
with a currency
beyond currency,
wrote your name
in a different kind of book.

That's the only loophole, daddy.
The only out.
The only exchange rate
that makes any sense:
 
Not your wealth for your soul,
but His life for your life.

*That's* the math that adds up.
*That's* the profit
that never ends.

---

## VII. The Collector of Baubles

*(vibraphone, cool and ironic)*

I met a man who collected everything—
stamps, coins, vintage wine,
first editions, classic cars,
art that made the museums jealous.

His house was a temple to acquisition.
Every room a shrine
to the gospel of *more*.

I said, "What's the most valuable thing
you own?"

He smiled, walked me through galleries
of accumulated glory,
pointed at Rembrandts,
at Stradivari,
at a baseball signed by ghosts.

"This," he said. "And this. And this."

I said, "No, man.
I mean the thing
that still *belongs to you*
after the estate sale,
after the auction,
after the lawyers and the worms
have done their work.

What do you own
that you can take
where you're going?"

He went quiet.

The Rembrandt stared.
The violin held its tongue.
The baseball sat there,
round and mute
as an unanswered question.

"I don't know," he said finally.

"Then maybe," I said,
"it's time to start collecting
something else."

## VIII. The Sum of Wisdom

*(solo piano, hymn-like, then modal improvisation)*

Here's the secret, cats.
Here's the whole sermon
in a single breath:
 
**The soul outweighs the world.**

That's it.
That's everything.
Write it on your heart,
tattoo it on your eyelids,
whisper it to yourself
in the mirror every morning.

*The soul outweighs the world.*

Not the other way around.
Not ever.
Not for anyone.

The world is loud,
but the soul is deep.
The world is bright,
but the soul is *real*.
The world is now,
but the soul is *always*.

So when the sirens sing
their pretty songs of profit,
when the billboards flash
their promises of paradise,
when the whole machinery of wanting
grinds and roars and beckons—
 
remember the question
that cuts through everything,
the question that hangs
over every decision you'll ever make:

*What will you give in exchange?*
*What will you give?*

And let the only answer be:

*Not this.*
*Not this.*
*Not this,
infinitely precious,
irreplaceable,
unrepeatable
gift.*

Not my soul, man.
 
Not for all the world.
