***MelonCave is about caving in the melons of those personal demons which drive the bad habits of being ourselves. Caving in these melons is an absolutely serious attack or war for our souls ... although we may defend them, rationalize them or try to ignore them, those personal demons aggressively hold us back and condemn our spiritual being.***

# Items To Ponder As Advice For My Younger Self

I had an inkling of these things, but I was unsure -- I didn't KNOW these things. What I wish I ***knew*** when I was fifteen:

1) TAKE GREATER responsibility for your own education, growth and aspirations. Respect them, but do NOT rely on teachers or coaches or even parents or relatives ... the BASICS of school are important for getting along in life, ie prep for standardized SAT/ACT tests and take example tests to understand shortcomings in BASIC math/chem/physics/scientific method OR BASIC reading/writing/information/knowledge ... standardized test of BASIC knowledge matter, but NOBODY else can do the WORK of self-awareness and taking responsibility for you education, growth and aspirations -- others just do not and cannot *KNOW* **you** like ***YOU MUST KNOW YOU*** ... become more self-aware, become more autodidactic ... *grow up faster to establish your independence and be ready to be your own parent -- to some degree, you probably have to be the parent for your parents ... so GROW UP!!!*

2) Seek to share skills and train others, so that you may learn. The person who learns the most, the broadest, the deepest in any classroom or seminar or workshop or training session is the person who is actually attempting to genuinely train and help improve the people in the class ... that's because the person who is training others has to prepare, organize, think through and understand the material at a much deeper level, from multiple perspectives, in order to be able how to best get the ideas across to others who learn from different perspectives, backgrounds, with different intentions. SOME of the people in the class, workshop, or coaching session will have something to add -- so it's important to be prepared in order to opportunistically use those people or different serindiptious situations that arise in order to INCLUDE others and incentivize them to contribute. WHEN you have the opportunity to teach others, TAKE IT! When you don't have those opportunities, create them with things like participating in Toastmasters or doing podcasts or volunteering to help teaching others.

3) The ONLY asset that you really possess in this life is your own TIME, ATTENTION and **FOCUS** ... humans BECOME what they spend their time and attention **focusing** on. Know your why? Surround yourself with people who know their way -- but AVOID people who fail to respect the WHY of others and insist on only seeing things their way. It is completely unimportant to just stay busy; refuse to equate time management with having every fifteen minute time block in your 168 hour week scheduled, although it will be important at times to just get busy doing what you least want to do but know that you should do, ie if you ever bored and don't know what to do, do 8 sets of pull-ups, pushups, burpees, hitting/kicking the heavy bag, doing dead lifts or doing yoga/flexibility exercises -- read or write, but NEVER just watch television or movies.  It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to FOCUS your time, effort and intensity on the RIGHT things which you know are right because you have paid attention and thought about what truly matters. The ONLY asset that you really possess in this life is your own TIME, ATTENTION and FOCUS.

4) From any paycheck, including the assets that you cash in, make sure that you INVEST more than you SPEND. How you invest is very important, but don't expect to get your investment back, even if you are buying T-bills ... DIVERSIFY, DIVERSIFY, DIVERSIFY ... but be sure to INVEST in things that are growing and have the potential to pay you back 100-fold or 1000-fold over the next 10-25 years. DO NOT speculate ... INVEST in things that have the solid potential to GROW by making people radically more productive, efficient, healthy, or much less needy, ie don't invest in things like Coca-cola or Disney or automobiles or anything that addicts people to comfort. GROWTH comes from empowering people to radically more productive, efficient, healthy, or much less needy. In order to be less needy yourself, you will need to consume less than anyone you know -- THAT is why from every paycheck, including the assets that you cash in, you must be sure to INVEST much more than you SPEND. Consuming less must be your superpower ... as a general rule,***AVOID people who consume more than they invest like the plague that they are.***

5) INVEST in your circle of **competent** colleagues and friends; invest more in competence and ability. Understand the competence of others, as well as their strengths and weakness; understand their motivations, what they feel threatened by as well as blind spots they don't see; make yourself more competent and more worth knowing, even if they never find out about your competence, ie BE ***READY***! You learned how to make friends with the smartest, most capable kid in the room or on the playground when you were three years old -- so don't forget the lessons in networking that you learned on the playground or in Sunday School. Networking is more important than knowledge, skills, aptitudes, good looks ... but don't just network -- you have to INVEST in your network of the most important people in your surroundings or those from the outside affecting your surroundings, ie of course that includes your family members, friends, but that also means paying greater attention to your housekeeper in a hotel or waiter in a restaurant.  In some cases, you cannot or should not meet people around you -- but you MUST pay greater attention to them and notice all kinds of things about them. You can learn a lot from criminals, homeless people, developmentally disabled people, mentally ill people, addicts, prostitutes ... the IMPORTANT thing is be observant and pay attention to people around you ... ***VERY, VERY, VERY people are truly worth knowing or listening to***, but you cannot really sort out who is most important to focus on, UNLESS you can focus on observing people. Networking is more important than knowledge, skills, aptitudes, good looks ... but don't just network.

6) AVOID gossips and people who waste time worrying about their reputation or feeding their ego; gossips are even worst than a waste of your time. Gossips will drag you down to their disgusting level and make conscious of your reputation among gossips and the truly inconsequential people on Earth. Learn to PROSPECT for greater competence; SEEK OUT the people who make a difference and study them, rather than EVER worrying about what people think of you. Avoid actors, celebrities, trial lawyers and anyone whose profession is built on developing skill or competence in bearing false witness or somehow giving a performance that is about bending the truth or advocating for a misrepresentation of the truth. Avoid materialists and people who waste ANY time worrying about material wealth ... you cannot afford to be associated with people who are insecure about something as silly as wealth,reputation or humanities evaluation of their worth. The ONLY evaluation that you can be concerned with is your Creator's opinion of your merit.

7) Learn to enjoy **working** on and **focusing more** on your interests. Inevitably, this means that you must AVOID partying, partiers and anyone who's purpose is about vacationing or distractions or, at least, avoid those who don't have things to work or focus on and who primary interest is in following others, finding entertaining distractions, living for vacations, indulging their hobbies or collections of toys -- above all, avoid those simply *just wanna get fucked up*. NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER partake in any sort of substance that partiers use to alter their consciousness, ie this is not just alcohol, marijuana, psychedelics, cocaine, methamphetamines, opioids, etc or any kind of activity like being spectator, gossip or person engaged in some sort of activity that makes you stupider or less worth knowing.  The ONLY kind ofsubstance that you should EVER use to alter your consciousness is something that highly capable people use, like CAFFEINE or a cup of coffee either socially or early in the morning ... and even then, use it sparingly and strategically.  The ONLY acceptable way to truly alter your consciousness is through prayer, meditation, fasting and intense physical exercise. If you want to wake up in the morning, do exercises ... if you want to focus during the day, go for a walk WITHOUT your phone headphones ... if you want to sleep better at night, tire yourself out during the day -- if you can't sleep at night, get up and WORK, but don't take a nap, so that you sleep at night.  The ONLY acceptable way to truly alter your consciousness is through prayer, meditation, fasting and intense physical exercise ... but AVOID partying and any form of partier or distractionist! 

8) Be more GRATEFUL; make your religion into being all about gratitude and the adoration of the Source of all blessings in all existences in all universes. Let your worship be about sharing the LOVE that you have found through your gratitude discipline. Try different things to develop greater gratitude discipline such as daily writing, revising, rewriting in your gratitude journal. STOP WORRYING about what you will lose -- perfecting our lives is mostly about what is taken away, especially when what is taken from us is not something we would choose to remove.  It's not what you do or what you add -- it's mostly about what you take away. The most important thing we can do in life is to PERFECT our lives, to simplify and make ourselves more capable of serving ... perfecting our lives is about overcoming the bad habits of being ourselves.

9) The whole point of exercise is about improving your DISCIPLINE and self-awareness. Don't just EXERCISE more; exercise SMARTER with planning, intention, discipline. Discipline equals more freedom in all things. Don't just READ more or read faster, but develop better knowledge management systems and AI-assisted knowledge engineering discipline. Develop the discipline of FORGIVING and letting go of attachments unceasingly, so that you are able to PRAY more or pray without ceasing, without ever worrying about reptuation or other regrets or worries. You might MEDITATE more or practice breathwork discipline, so that you are able to pray without ceasing ... but the point of meditation is not to achieve enlightenment through just sitting -- meditation as a mental exercise has to be about the discipline of letting go. As a general rule, you should try to understand so that you might SERVE BETTER, not more or write bigger checks. LOVE better, when it's NEEDED -- not more, when your hugs or displays of affection are about you. Do the things that are tough to do and the kinds of things that nobody can possibly see. Do MORE of those things ... and do NOT just do them when you feel like it, or when you have time ... MAKE TIME for these things EVERY DAY; stop being busy or being seen as busy. The disciplines that matter are the things nobody sees -- that's why they are the most important things that you can do to perfect your life, to simplify and make yourself more capable of serving.

1)    MOST IMPORTANTLY ... never, ever, ever, ever forget Mark 8:36 "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"  Study books like "The Imitation of Christ" by Thomas a Kempis, with an aim toward writing your own version of what it means to be a better disciple of Christ.  Study the lives of saints like St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. Therese of Lisieux, St. Catherine of Siena, St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila ... and try to write your own version of what it means to be a better disciple of Christ, but NEVER stop asking the Lord to show you his will for your life ... ***NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER forget Mark 8:36 "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"***

---

Let the ONE question of Mark 8:36 echo through every decision, every investment, every moment of attention: *"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?"* 

**The rest is commentary or elaboration.**

11) Develop and build a competence in knowledge engineering and intelligence gathering ... this is NOT about the information technology or AI, per se ... it's about understanding one's interests, aptitudes, skills, and capabilities in order to do a better job of seeking out collaborators, competitors, and mentors/mentees. Knowledge engineering and intelligence gathering is mostly about SERVING better ... it's NOT about accumulating more information or data or even knowledge for its own sake.  It's about SERVING better.

12) Develop your gratitude discipline every chance that you get.Gratitude is everything ... NEVER EVER EVER focus on what you don't have, what you don't need and things that you merely want ... spend more time being grateful for things that you have, including your health and all of the freely available knowledge around you. Polish your health with applied knowledge and body awareness.

13) Always be looking for better ways to serve more effectively, especially when means finding a better employer. KNOW YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

Here is a comprehensive list of 500 ideas for you to ponder as you refine and expand your Legacy Manifesto toward 365 principles. These ideas draw inspiration from the spiritual, humble, and God-centered themes in your provided start (e.g., uniqueness, revelation, humility, submission, detachment, solitude, anti-conformity, material emptiness, relational paradoxes, and the unfinished nature of life's discovery). I've also woven in metaphorical and practical inspirations from Howard Lutnick's strategies for America's economic growth in 2026—such as tariffs as protective boundaries, trade negotiations as wise stewardship, reshoring as returning to core essentials, self-sufficiency as spiritual independence, efficiency and modernization as streamlining for purpose, selective immigration as discerning influences, high-wage jobs as valuing eternal rewards, and overall growth as holistic personal/spiritual expansion under God's guidance.
