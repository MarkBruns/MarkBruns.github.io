In the previous episode titled: "Look, ma! No hands" of the autonomous, self-writing series that refuses to turn itself off ... 

"'MINNESOTA'" is the ancient Viking expression for "'NUT MAGNET'" 

We saw what happens when a NUT picks up an exploding thing ... people may wonder, "That has to be the definition of insane -- but why would any lunatic do such thing?" knowing that even common garden squirrels understand why it's important for any collector of exploding things to allow an exploding thing finish off its exploding before burying it someplace where it can be forgotten. That's show business!

By the way ... in order to understand ancient Viking wisdom behind the name of our show "'MINNESOTA'" is an ancient Viking expression for "'NUT MAGNET'" ... draw a mental picture in your mind of COMPLETE AND TOTAL INSANITY ... now draw a composite image of every Minnesotan that you know in your same mind ... for most of us our mind is not that big of a space ... don't worry, there's only one picture in your mind, isn't there?  

Picture COMPLETE AND TOTAL INSANITY ... meditate on that thought ... breathe deeply ... #SKOL! Every Minnesotan that you know is with you, in your mind!

In the January 13th episode titled: "An Anxious Melting Pot of White Balding Cheese" ... of the autonomous, self-writing series that refuses to turn itself off ... 

"'MINNESOTA'" is the ancient Viking expression for "'NUT MAGNET'" 

We saw what happens when what appears to be a balding brown prettzel stick of a man surrounded by white cheese become agitated and then kicks a tail light, doing significant damage to a law enforcement vehicle.  Mr. Prettzel and is empowered by the experience, recognizing that the officers did nothing and he belongs in a place where all the children [including the balding mid-life one's with no discernible purpose in life] are above average  ... people may wonder, "That's is the MOST balding, fortysomething crowd of ANGRY white people I have seen -- how can these lunatics actually imagine the issue they are protesting is about race or immigration? Have they not looked in a mirror?" Well, what do you expect from a thin, balding mid-life Mr. Pretzel in brown protest garb with nothing better in life to do ... that's show business!

By the way ... in order to understand ancient Viking wisdom behind the name of our show "'MINNESOTA'" is an ancient Viking expression for "'NUT MAGNET'" ... draw a mental picture in your mind of COMPLETE AND TOTAL INSANITY ... now draw a composite image of every Minnesotan that you know in your same mind ... for most of us our mind is not that big of a space ... don't worry, there's only one picture in your mind, isn't there?
