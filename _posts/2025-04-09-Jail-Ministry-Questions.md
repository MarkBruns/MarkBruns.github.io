# Questions For Me to Ponder About Prison Ministry

This is mostly about *attempting* to ***walk in the light*** ... on the path to the finding truth, on the path to JOY ... J O Y comes from putting Jesus First, living in gratitude and giving all of the glory for all blessing to God ... THEN it's about respecting and loving OTHERS as we respect and love ourselves ... which mean that YOU and your EGO have to take the back seat ... *because when you insist on making it all about you, then you get to stay in your prison* ... that's the path to J O Y ... Jesus, Others, You.

## REDEMPTION AND FORGIVENESS

1. **How can I accept God's forgiveness when I cannot forgive myself?**

   
* *"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling. We all fail; people who don't acknowledge failure are evidently pretty good at lying to themselves if they actually believe that -- but that's typical human behavior. There are people who have never failed because they have never had the courage to even try, thus they fail to live, fail to experience life, fail to take chances or strive or screw up. The glory that comes from rising every time we fall must go to God. We are blessed by our failures and our chance to grow closer to God"*

* "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." ([1 John 1:9](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html)).  Similar to the opening passages of Genesis and the Gospel of John, ([1 John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-1.html)) starts with a clear connection between Jesus and God the Father as the beginning of all things. John also refers to the idea of Jesus coming to earth to give us Life as a living flesh-and-blood man ([1 John 1:2](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-2.html)), which is a critical part of the gospel, which we are all to proclaim ([1 John 1:3](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-3.html)). From ([1 John 1:4](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-4.html)), we are reminded that A Christian can be filled with JOY, knowing that he or she does not need to guess whether he or she will have eternal life. Those who know God and love others proclaim the gospel by showing evidence God is in their life. When we walk in the light per ([1 John 1:5](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-5.html)) to remind ourselves that God is entirely goodness and truth, with no evil or falsehood. But when we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, per ([1 John 1:6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-6.html)) we lie to ourselves [and possibly others] by not practicing the light of truth. As this letter from John reminds us in ([1 John 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-7.html)), that John the Baptist spoke about Jesus as not only the "light" but even the "TRUE light" [John 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-8.html); this is about how Jesus Christ becomes the driver of truth in our lives, as we are to repent and call people to repentance in preparation for His arrival. Returning to this letter, in ([1 John 1:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-8.html)), we are reminded that believers who have accepted salvation are then called to walk in the light according to Christ's ways to bear witness, but when we say we have no sin, the we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. Those who confess sins are reassured that God will forgive, ([1 John 1:9](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html)) and remove that sin's impact on fellowship ... but as we know from [Colossians 3:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-13.html) or [Ephesians 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-7.html) forgiveness was purchased for us by Jesus and is thus a grace that we can ask for in prayer, but not something that we can just will into being or do through our own actions. Confession of sins has always been seen as a sacred practice of prayer, sacrifice, worship among those who turn to the Lord ([Leviticus 5:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/5/Leviticus-5-5.html) or [16:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/16/Leviticus-16-21.html); [Numbers 5:7](https://www.bibleref.com/Numbers/5/Numbers-5-7.html); [Ezra 10:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezra/10/Ezra-10-1.html)) and has been seen as a source of healing ([James 5:16](https://www.bibleref.com/James/5/James-5-16.html)). "As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us." ([Psalm 103:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/103/Psalm-103-12.html))
