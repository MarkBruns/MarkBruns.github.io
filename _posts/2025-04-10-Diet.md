## KEY Points Nutrition Plan

Optimal nutrition sort of begins with ***NEVER EVER just sitting*** ... that especially means **NEVER EVER sitting down to eat by oneself.** 

*The impact of sitting only gets worse when lazy, fat vehicle-addicted fucks progam themselves to do lazy fuck vehicle-addicted shit like getting food from a drive-through and then SIT and eat in their cozy vehicles.*  That kind of idiotic bullshit is why lazy, fat, vehicle-addicted fucks need to schedule lots of time in the doctor's anal love nest getting digitally-probed for the extra colon cancer that comes from being a lazy, fat, vehicle-addicted fuck ... *life is not actually supposed to be about extra time in your doctor's anal love nest! But the life that people get is an artifact of the habits they practice over their lifetime.* 

**Even great nutrition cannot overcome being a disgusting, sessile blob of atrophying tissue.  Sitting KILLS!**  Stop killing yourself with your sitting!

Make sitting more difficult if you have to. I have gotten rid of all chairs in my home/office, but I still use a stability ball [as therapy for some **serious** old back injuries, ie moving is okay, but I cannot stand in one position, at a desk, all day].  But, even the stability ball workflow is not sufficient -- I have been programmed throughout my life to just sit or to just stay sit.  Unlearning decads of horrendously bad programming is next to impossible ... even though I know better, I have to continually ask myself, "***Exactly WHO is paying you SIT? WHY are you sitting again?!***"

### Stop Using Food As An Emotional Crutch

I avoid standard meal times like the PLAGUE upon humankind that such routines are. Yes, of course, I get together with people to meet for lunch or to attend a meeting at a restaurants ... that's *somewhat* different -- I don't really enjoy it, but I do it because there are bigger things to consider, ie like attending Mass.

I have LEARNED, again and again, to NEVER EVER EVER treat food as the basis / structure around which a daily routine is built ... it's different for families or groups, but for SOLO individuals, the **time** when one enhales food cannot be the basis of your daily structure/organization. 

It is ESSENTIAL to NEVER treat food as the basis of some sort of emotional crutch; making *standard* food consumption times into some sort of religious ritual is fundamentally about programming brains to become emotionally dependent upon using food swallowing as the daily metronome driving the day ... and removal of that behavior pattern requires MASSIVE reprogramming.

I have LEARNED, again and again and still yet again ... to ONLY to eat when I am VERY hungry.  OTHERWISE, I put on weight and turn into a fat fuck ... or ***fatter*** fuck.

EVEN when I have the discipline to ONLY eat when I am hungry, it is only acceptable for me to eat AFTER asking the Lord to first bless the meal and to earnestly ask [and visualize the Lord guiding those nutrients to complete my ask] that the nutrients be put to their highest and best use. **Prayer is essential for a joyous life ... ALL DAY LONG, but ESPECIALLY before eating.**

### Exercise, Exercise, Exercise

- STOP treating exercise as a special activity; exercise throughout your day ... in the same manner, that fat pigs who are fattening themselves for slaughter eat snacks and pride themselves on their cooking/baking/eating prowess throughout their day.

- When I think I need a "snack" I try take a break to exercise ... if only to REMIND myself that I don't ever need to SWALLOW a snack ... I can do/try a new mobility WOD ... do some shrimping drills or other solo drill for jiujitsu ... hit/kick the heavy bag ... lift weights ... go for a walk ... plant my garden ... pull weeds ... transplant shrubs ... sculpt landscaping. 

- I am trying to timeblock my day, 30 x 30 minute blocks with each block made up of 25 pomodoro and a 4 minute HIIT tabata, but my mind is resistant to that kind of structure ... but I keep trying to structually, time-routinize exercise, ie if people can be programmed to eat lunch at noon, I can probably program myself to exercise for 4 minutes every 30 minutes. 

- I do not EVER go to a gym ... I have removed all "living room" like space in my home -- my LIVING has to be that of being in a dojo or gym ... I HAVE TO **live in** a dogo or a gym, or I will turn into a fat pig and become miserable waiting to die.

### Remove The Linkage Between Timing / Daily Routines and Feeding

- Experience has taught me that one-meal-a-day diet OR some variation on intermittent fasting works best for me ... but MOSTLY, it's about refusing to eat until AFTER I have noticed that I am hungry ... the timing is not driven by time of day; it is driven by waiting until AFTER I am really hungry and have noticed that I am really hungry.  Effectively, this means that during different seasons, I eat at different times of day ... my workday and workflow through the day drives my hunger which drives the timing of when I eat ... I do not allow a certain time on the clock to drive the timing of when I eat -- that kind of behavior is for FAT people, not for me.

- I have tried to consider timing my single meal post-activity for optimal recovery, but that's just based on bullshit junk science based on rationalizing food industry norms anyway; what is NECESSARY is to remove thinking about timing.

### Hydration

- Hydrate more to piss out more poison and give your kidneys a decent environment. Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before, during, and after physical activity.

- Hydrate more. When over-hydration becomes a recognized health problem ... it will be danged easy to teach oneself to hydrate less.

## Executive Summary

Based on your specific dietary preferences and activity level (3-5 hours of vigorous physical activity daily), this report outlines the most cost-effective approach to meeting your nutritional needs. The analysis confirms that affordable animal proteins like whole milk, eggs, and pork loins can effectively meet your protein and caloric requirements, supplemented by garden produce and berries for carbohydrates and micronutrients. Following a one-meal-a-day approach, your estimated daily food cost would be approximately $2.15/day, making this a sustainable and economical nutrition strategy.

## Nutritional Requirements

Research suggests that for your activity level, daily nutritional needs include:
- Calories: 2500-3500 kcal/day
- Protein: 100-150g/day (1.2-2.0g/kg body weight)
- Carbohydrates: ~400g/day (adjusted for grain restrictions)
- Fats: 67-117g/day (20-35% of total calories)

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Protein Sources

### Whole Milk ($4/gallon)
- Nutritional Content: 150 kcal, 8g protein, 8g fat, 12g carbs per cup
- Cost Analysis: $0.0017/kcal; $0.03/g protein
- Recommendation: 1 quart/day (4 cups) providing ~960 kcal, 32g protein, 32g fat, 48g carbs for ~$1/day

### Eggs ($4/dozen)
- Nutritional Content: 72 kcal, 6g protein, 5g fat, 0.6g carbs per large egg
- Cost Analysis: $0.0046/kcal; $0.056/g protein
- Recommendation: 4 eggs/day providing ~288 kcal, 24g protein, 20g fat for ~$0.33/day

### Pork Loins ($2/lb, raw)
- Nutritional Content: 198 kcal, 19.74g protein, 14.5g fat per 100g raw
- Cooking Loss: ~25% weight loss during cooking
- Cost Analysis: $0.0022/kcal; $0.022/g protein
- Recommendation: 8 oz cooked/day (starting with 10 oz raw) providing ~784 kcal, 88g protein, 33g fat for ~$0.62/day

This analysis confirms that milk is the most cost-effective source per calorie and protein, followed by pork loins, then eggs.

## Sample One-Meal-a-Day Plan

### Meal Components
1. **Protein Base**:
   - 12-16 oz grilled pork loin (cooked weight)
   - 4 hard-boiled eggs

2. **Produce**:
   - Large salad (4 cups mixed greens, 1 cup carrots, 1 cup zucchini, and minimal nightshades)
   - Dressed with 1 tbsp olive oil and vinegar

3. **Beverages/Additional**:
   - 1 quart whole milk or milk-frozen-berry smoothie

### Nutritional Analysis
- Total Calories: ~2152 kcal (base meal) + additional from berries (~3000 kcal total)
- Protein: ~144g
- Carbohydrates: ~400g (with berries)
- Fat: ~99g

### Cost Analysis
- Milk: ~$1.00
- Eggs: ~$0.33
- Pork: ~$0.62
- Olive Oil: ~$0.20
- Garden Produce/Berries: ~$0 (assuming home-grown)
- **Total Daily Cost**: ~$2.15

## Additional Considerations

### Supplementation
- Consider basic supplements if garden produce lacks certain nutrients:
  - Vitamin D3: Especially important in Winter, when sun exposure is limited
  - Magnesium: Almost always under-consumed, supports muscle function
  - Iodine: in iodized salt, but also poured into epsom salt foot soaking
  - Estimated cost: $0.50-1.00/day depending on choices

### Beans in Moderation
- Include 1 cup cooked/re-fried black beans 2-3 times/week for variety and additional nutrients, costing ~$0.50 per serving if purchased dry and cooked at home.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Meal Preparation**:
   - Prepare pork loins in bulk (grilling or roasting) and store portions for convenience
   - Hard-boil eggs in batches for easy consumption
   - Prepare large salads with garden vegetables

2. **Intermittent Fasting Schedule**:
   - Eat only when genuinely hungry
   - Potentially time meal post-activity for optimal recovery
   - Avoid forcing meals at conventional mealtimes

3. **Hydration Strategy**:
   - Maintain water intake throughout the day
   - Use milk strategically for both nutrition and hydration

This nutrition plan is specifically designed to align with your dietary preferences, activity level, and budget constraints while providing optimal nutrition for performance and recovery.
