# Keep your heart with all vigilance

These ruminations arouse out of some reflections recently on Solomon's admonition in [Proverbs 4:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-23.html) "***Keep your heart with all vigilance***, *for from it flow* **the springs of life.**" 


1. What specific practices does [Philippians 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-8.html) suggest for guarding your heart? As you will recall, the text of that passage in Philippians is ...*Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise,* **THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS.** For me, the MOST IMPORTANT lesson I learned in 2024 was the NECESSITY of **daily** gratitude journalling. We are commanded to focus our lives on all of the serindipitous little things that arise. In all likelihood, those things are not randomly placed in our lives. But, what matters is that even if those serindipitous little things were to some degree random, what definitely is NOT remotely close being random is our ability to NOTICE *whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise* and to intentionally MEDITATE, ie asking the Holy Spirit to guide us, on how we might replicate more of those good examples and maybe even **anonymously** "pour gas on those fires" **in a manner that pleases and glorifies God**. In other words, mere public virtue signalling is PURELY EVIL, but we ***can*** be quietly grateful [and record our thoughts in our gratitude journals for us to come back to and **THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS** over and over, again and again, to help us in adapt those best practices **taking them to heart** from whereever we find them ... AND we ***can*** do what we can to *quietly,* but forcefully try to let people know that their efforts **have** been NOTICED, which leads into [Proverbs 27:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/27/Proverbs-27-19.html) ("As water reflects the face, so the heart reflects the person") can deepen your understanding of what Solomon is getting at in [Proverbs 4:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-23.html)? Of course, calm water acts as a mirror and self-examination is a good and necessary thing, but one learns more about how one is perceived by seeing how words and actions are received over long periods of time by others ... never mind initial reactions, particularly when one's thoughts have stunned someone or made them  uncomfortable -- the TEST of one's reflection is seen in behavior over time and things like being thanked for something you once did or something once stood up for. As we know from different stories of the prophets, eg Jeremiah 17:9, the natural human heart as deceitful and desperately wicked, thus one should **never waste much energy on merely trying to be liked.**

2. We might think about Jesus's teachings on trees being recognized by their fruit in [Matthew 7:17-20](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-17.html) to parallel Solomon's metaphor of the heart as a spring here in Proverbs. Jesus warned His listeners to beware of false prophets. They may look like sheep, but they're actually hungry wolves. The way to properly identify them is by their fruit: what grows from their lives and teaching. Grapes don't grow on thorn bushes, and figs don't spring from thistle plants. In the same way, legitimate spiritual fruit ([Galatians 5:22–24](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html)) comes from a true believer and Paul offers a list of what what those in Christ should expect to begin see flowing from their lives when they let the Holy Spirit lead them. Paul calls this the "fruit of the Spirit" and it includes agapē or "**selfless love** as an attitude that considers other people more than ourselves, without expecting anything in return. Inner confidence or chara or JOY, which is not exactly happiness, but a knowledge that our soul that all is well with us, now and forever, because of the priority we place upon Jesus Christ and then fellowship with others and finally our own wants/needs ... **J O Y comes from Jesus, Others, then You** ... J, O, Y. The next thing on the list is peace and the concept of **restful, assured, actively-aware patient stillness** and the ability to remain at peace, while waiting, while enduring hardship, while "weathering the storm." Kindness might seem obvious, but this is not about being reciprocally kind or kind to nice people -- in this sense, kindness does mean being good and gentle, but in this case, it especially about **being kind to those who are struggling to manage their pain** and thus are unusually challenging, even offensive and hard to like. Goodness is another thing on the list and it does not mean being nice or ostentaciously pious or [self-]righteous -- **goodness means moral decency and ablity to do the most right thing***, and that means the most couragous thing in ever circumstance. Finally, this list also includes **faithfulness** which represents a special kind of endurance, driven by trusting in the Spirit, even when we do not understand where God is leading us. 

3. We can think about what insights about the relationship between heart vigilance and spiritual fruit we have gained from Jesus's teaching in [John 15:1-11](https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-1.html)? "**I am** the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser." This is the seventh of seven times in the gospel of John where Jesus uses the "**I Am**" terminology. The phrasing echoes God's words to Moses when speaking from the burning bush (Exodus 3:14). As with the other "**I Am**" comments (John 6:35; 8:12; 10:7–9, 11; 11:25; 14:6), Jesus not only makes a subtle claim to divinity, He reveals a crucial aspect of how God relates to mankind. As Jesus introduces this symbolism, He evokes Old Testament ideas of God as a "vinedresser," relating to His people much the same way someone might grow and nurture a plant in their garden or farm. That process includes things like pruning and removal of dead or diseased branches as Jesus mentions in [John 15:2](https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-2.html) "Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit." **I Am** ***is*** the Creator constantly creating and tending His creation ... if we do not keep our heart with ALL of our vigilance ... *the branch does not bear fruit gets pruned and discarded.*
