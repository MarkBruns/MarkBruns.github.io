# 50 Questions for Reflecting on Improving Mental Focus and Attention

"Keeping our eyes on Jesus, the source and perfecter of our faith." [Hebrews 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-2.html) On Good Friday, we are particularly reminded of how Jesus serves as the ultimate example of intensity of His mental focus, His steadfast attention to His mission and not getting sidetracked with adoration of crowds or the advice from disciples. Christ also suffered hardship and persecution at other times ([Philippians 2:8-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-8.html)); He came to earth in human form as a servant. Jesus both was born and died in humility. His humbleness was not for show, but was part of being an example of obedience. We are to be humble in obedience to Christ, following both the example of Jesus ... and the apostles. Jesus was tempted ([Hebrews 4:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html)), but Christ, in enduring our temptations without failure, experienced their weight far beyond the point where we would have failed and given in. Finally, in going through with the crucifixion and descent into Hell, Jesus never wavered in His resolve to do the will of God the Father ([Hebrews 5:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/5/Hebrews-5-8.html)) even as he could see the future before it unfolded. Christ's entire ministry and the superiority of the **new covenant** (Hebrews 10:12–14)[https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-14.html] are grounded in His example, which we should strive to follow ([Hebrews 2:10–11](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-10.html)). His willingness to endure those trials came from an understanding that God could, and would, "work together for good" all of those things ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-28.html)). The end goal of Jesus' obedience was to establish the purpose we should be striving for: the "city with foundations" ([Hebrews 11:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-10.html)), our ultimate victory and reward in God ([Hebrews 11:13–16](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-13.html); [Revelation 21:1–14](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-1.html)) as for Abraham and Sarah or John in the NEW heaven and NEW earth. Our focus and attention have to be a matter of J O Y ... Jesus, Others, You -- in that precedence ... because as Christians, God's ultimate purpose for us has to be forward-looking, not longing for the past ... not toward an old earth, but a NEW heaven.
