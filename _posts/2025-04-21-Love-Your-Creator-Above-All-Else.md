Per [Mark 12:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/12/Mark-12-30.html) ... and plenty of other places in scripture ... we are to "love **the Lord your God** with ***all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength***." We are to love our Creator, giving that love FIRST priority; we are to love all others as we love ourselves, but that is a SECOND priority. "Heart" is from the Greek root word kardia, and means the center of one's life, whether physical, spiritual, or mental. The heart drives one's beliefs, emotions, thoughts, and intentions. "Soul" is from the Greek root word psychÄ“ which is similar to the heart, but focuses on the vital force that keeps us alive. 

It's important to note that the word ***"mind"*** is not found in the original Old Testament quotes, eg [Deuteronomy 6:5](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Deuteronomy_6:5-7), but we see how the message has adapted to fit different self-concepts. By the time Jesus was walking on earth, it way is certainly appropriate to add for an audience influenced by more logical Greek knowledge, technology, education and culture. The word "mind" comes from the Greek root word dianoia and, again, has a similar definition to heart but with a more mental bent.

The Biblical view of humans is that of integrated whole spiritual beings ... which differs from the materialist, egocentric, self-worshiping modern perspectives ... but the point's the same ... it's okay to think about me, the self, etc ... it's just that it must take a back seat.

J ... is for Jesus

O ... is for OTHER bigger causes, eg perhaps an oath to support and defend the Constitution OR maybe Nature and the love of the Creator's natural beauty ... it's why we plant trees, or preserve National Parks, or do things for OTHERS we will never know.

Y ... is for you and me ... and when we put you and me and and your trivial bullshit ahead of other MUCH larger causes we deserve to be forgotten ... when we put you and me ahead of Jesus, we deserve eternal damnation and to never be heard from again.

It's VERY simple ... get your priorities right ... and you get J O Y !!!
