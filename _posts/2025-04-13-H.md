## H. Eternal Investment

Investing and ownership of legacy investments matters, but **WHY is it so necessary for us as stewards to give ALL glory to God?** 

It's not about just being well-behaved little kids in Sunday School and doing what we were told to do. The hard, cold, absolute physical Reality is that, as we know, from our experience in tiny human things, when you don't take care of the asset, when you can't defend an asset, well ... you don't deserve to own it ... and are soon parted from it. 

Some assets, like a little collection of material stuff or even property do not really matter that much BY COMPARISON -- but things like cropland and soil stewardship have helped us begin to understand the lessons surrounding the concept of legacy investments and being a steward of those assets. 

THIS is way, way bigger than mere cropland ... it is about the grandest of all Grand Legacy investments, lasting far longer and taking  precedence over all earthly human legacies lasting hundreds or thousands of years. The GRAND Legacy of eternity beyond human-scale comprehension. 

Building a LASTING permanent legacy by investing in the lives of others beyond any human's comprehension and representing lives that will not be born for hundreds or thousands of years is what contributing to the advancement of God's *heavenly* Kingdom is about. 

It's not just happy talk or regurgitating a Sunday School lesson.  We cannot see these contributions to advancement of this realm as a future, post-self, trite little vision of heaven or an after-life. It's BIGGER and even GRANDER than that.

Stewardship of eternal investments starts with what you do right NOW, in the coming day, week, month ... not something to put off. This has to involve actively discipling, working becoming a better disciple ... and possibly mentoring younger believers, being a better example in order to evangelize and advance other Kingdom initiatives, and using personal resources, especially time/focus/energy to give glory to God and further the Gospel. 

This focus on eternal rewards reflects a deep understanding of the temporal nature of earthly life and a desire to store up treasures in Heaven. The BIG PROBLEM is that human scale thinking cannot begin to understand an eternal perspective ... if anyone still has not understood why this is far beyond just a notion of mere Time or spacetime, then that person still has not even BEGUN to understand this eternal perspective.

As we understand when we contemplate both simultaneously, our scriptural understanding actually aligns remarkably with cutting-edge theoretical physics. Many physicists now recognize that the Universe and all laws governing it—including how gravity relates to time—might be temporary, illusory, and quite different from common human perception. Theories in quantum gravity suggest that fundamental entities may not be spatiotemporal, or that spacetime itself is not fundamental. The physical Earth is temporary; even the concept of Time as we understand it may be illusory.

## Investment Is About OWNERSHIP And Stewardship

# Stewardship REQUIRES Better Understanding The Eternal Perspective

### The Temporal Nature of Our World

How does our understanding of "eternity" shape our daily decisions and priorities? This question challenges us to think beyond human-scale comprehension, inviting us to expand our thinking in ways that might seem grandiose—yet even such expansive thinking may fall short of grasping eternity's true nature.

Scripture reminds us of this temporal reality in [1 John 2:17](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-17.html): "The world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever." This passage establishes a fundamental truth: our physical world is temporary, while those who follow God's will have eternal significance.

This scriptural understanding aligns remarkably with cutting-edge theoretical physics. Many physicists now recognize that the Universe and all laws governing it—including how gravity relates to time—might be temporary, illusory, and quite different from common human perception. Theories in quantum gravity suggest that fundamental entities may not be spatiotemporal, or that spacetime itself is not fundamental. The physical Earth is temporary; even the concept of Time as we understand it may be illusory.

### Time as an Emergent Phenomenon

Recent scientific exploration suggests that [time is an emergent phenomenon, possibly a side effect of quantum entanglement,](https://x.com/i/grok/share/9xoSxLRNdMBh8RjL9xraRzeYu) with increasing experimental evidence supporting this view. The Page-Wootters (PaW) mechanism hypothesis proposes that time emerges from quantum entanglement, an idea first fully theorized by Don Page and William Wootters in 1983.

This "problem of time" emerges from the canonical quantization of general relativity, yielding the Wheeler-DeWitt equation that predicts a static state of the universe—contradicting our everyday experience of time's passage. Page and Wootters proposed that quantum entanglement—where two quantum particles share the same existence despite physical separation—could provide a solution. They suggested that the evolution of entangled particles could function as a clock to measure change.

Their elegant hypothesis posits that time exists only for observers inside the universe, while any hypothetical "external" observer would see a static, unchanging universe. This aligns with the scriptural perspective presented in [2 Peter 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/2-peter/3/2-peter-3-8.html): "But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." God does not count time from a human perspective—the Creator exists beyond the constraints of time that limit human experience.

[Psalm 90:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/90/Psalm-90-4.html) further reinforces this truth: "For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night." Time does not bind the Creator; rather, the Creator is the origin of concepts like Time and physical scale.

### Experimental Support

In 2013, Ekaterina Moreva and colleagues at Italy's Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM) performed the first experimental test of Page and Wootters' ideas. They confirmed that time indeed appears as an emergent phenomenon for 'internal' observers while remaining absent for external ones.

Their experiment implemented the Page-Wootters mechanism using an entangled state of polarization between two photons. One photon served as a "clock" to gauge the evolution of the second photon. An "internal" observer becoming correlated with the clock photon would see the other system evolve, while an "external" observer observing only global properties could prove the system was static.

The profound implication of this research may be that quantum mechanics and general relativity are not as incompatible as previously thought. When viewed through the lens of entanglement, the famous "problem of time" begins to dissolve.

### Challenges to Consider

Despite the elegance of this theory and its experimental support, several challenges deserve consideration:

- [**Scale Problem**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pZb0uDFm_YrhauSfMJVmjwIUKGYODn5nJcFSiK7oeE/edit?usp=sharing): The Moreva experiment demonstrates the Page-Wootters mechanism in a controlled quantum system with just two entangled photons. Extending these results to explain time emergence in the macroscopic universe requires significant theoretical leaps.

- [**Decoherence Issues**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B8QLSbRSywz8babl14cV2O3W-KHZIf4fJkov-AzsxSU/edit?usp=sharing): Quantum systems in the real world interact with their environment, leading to decoherence that can destroy entanglement.

- [**Competing Theories**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDietpv-vGV38fT7Wrm9Jc7qvfZPvKTFclwNqvK4e8s/edit?usp=sharing): Other approaches to the problem of time in quantum gravity exist, including loop quantum gravity and string theory.

- [**Measurement Problem**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wzzn-c5Qs57LbmGMjcdGn1235DePq3fH7JRux96TgXg/edit?usp=sharing): The role of measurement and observers in quantum mechanics remains controversial.

- [**Thermodynamic Arrow of Time**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MSXzW9xGS62WuRmgAY6wE3EmQWZZdJEdtgZi1O22Eco/edit?usp=sharing): The thermodynamic arrow of time (entropy increase) must be reconciled with any quantum mechanical explanation of time's emergence.

### Scriptural Understanding of Eternity

What's remarkable is that Christians have long known—or should have known—about the temporary nature of our physical reality through Scripture. [Revelation 21:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-1.html) declares: "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more." Our Creator will instantiate a new Earth and a new Heaven.

This understanding shapes how we approach life's temporary desires. Wise people resist these temporary, evil desires, following the example of Jesus. As [Colossians 3:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-2.html) instructs us: "Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth."

[Ecclesiastes 3:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html) tells us that God "has put eternity into man's heart." We are created with an innate sense that there is more to existence than what we experience in this temporal world. This eternal perspective should inform our priorities and decisions.


## 100 Questions for Contemplation

1. **What are the implications Of attempting to better understanding an eternal perspective for our practical, ordinary daily lives?** Understanding the temporary nature of our physical world and the eternal nature of God's kingdom should not *materially* change our problemsolving skills for the ordinary problems we face, but it MUST reframe our perspective on daily life. [Matthew 6:19-21](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) advises: "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." When we pray for things, we should not be so demanding as if we are cranky little toddlers. There is no reason for the Creator to either wait or to rush in the same sense that mere humans do, locked as we are into minutes and hours and months. What seems like poor timing to us, as limited people, has a plan and purpose known only to God. As [Isaiah 55:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html) reminds us: "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." In conclusion, **BOTH** modern physics and ancient Scripture are in incredibly close agreement in pointing to a profound truth: our temporal understanding is limited, we must be more humble about humanity's prowess -- while the creative Force or God driving the creation of all laws shaping things like Space or Time or any eternal perspective is COMPLETE, inerrant. Living with an eternal perspective means recognizing the temporary nature of this world while orienting our lives toward what has eternal significance—loving God and loving others as Jesus taught in [Matthew 22:37-39](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/22/Matthew-22-37.html).


2. **What Scripture passages most powerfully reframe my temporal perspective toward eternity?** [Ecclesiastes 3:11:](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html) *God has placed eternity in the human heart, yet we cannot fully comprehend the scope of His divine plan. This tension between awareness of eternity and limitation in understanding it shapes our perspective. Solomon reflects on how God has designed humans with a unique capacity to contemplate eternity while still being bound by time, creating in us a longing that only eternal things can satisfy.* [Colossians 3:2:](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-2.html) *Paul urges believers to set their minds on things above, not on earthly things. This radical reorientation of thought redirects our perspective from temporal concerns to eternal values, shifting how we evaluate what truly matters.*

3. **How might I better comprehend the vast difference between even thousands of years and eternity?** [Psalm 90:4:](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/90/Psalm-90-4.html) *In God's sight, a thousand years pass like a day or a few hours in the night watch. This psalm, attributed to Moses, provides one of the most profound contrasts between human time-bound experience and God's eternal nature. It reminds us that what seems lengthy to us is but a moment to God, highlighting the vast gulf between our temporal existence and God's eternal being.* [Isaiah 40:28:](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-28.html) *The Creator of the ends of the earth neither faints nor grows weary; His understanding is unsearchable. Isaiah reminds us that God exists outside time's constraints and His perspective encompasses all of history simultaneously, a concept that helps us grasp the limitations of our temporal thinking.*

4. **What cultural narratives about legacy and impact most influence my thinking, and how do they align with Scripture?** [Matthew 6:19-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) *Jesus contrasts storing treasures on earth versus heaven, directly challenging cultural notions of legacy based on material accumulation or worldly recognition. This passage confronts our desire to leave a visible, temporal mark by redirecting our attention to lasting spiritual investments that transcend cultural definitions of success.* [Proverbs 13:22:](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/13/Proverbs-13-22.html) *A good person leaves an inheritance to their children's children. Scripture affirms the value of generational thinking but defines true inheritance more broadly than mere financial assets, encompassing spiritual legacy, wisdom, and faith passed to future generations.*

5. **How do I reconcile living fully in the present moment while investing for eternal impact?** [Matthew 6:33-34:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html) *Jesus instructs us to seek first God's kingdom and righteousness while not worrying about tomorrow. This profound teaching bridges the tension between present faithfulness and future focus, showing that kingdom priorities in the present moment are precisely what create eternal impact.* [Ephesians 5:15-17:](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/5/Ephesians-5-15.html) *Paul calls believers to make the most of every opportunity because the days are evil. This urgency about wisely using our present moments reflects an eternal perspective that values each day as an opportunity for kingdom investment.*

6. **What does it mean that "eternity starts with NOW," and how does this change my approach to today?** [John 17:3:](https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-3.html) *Jesus defines eternal life as knowing God and Jesus Christ whom He sent. This revolutionary definition frames eternal life not primarily as endless duration but as a quality of relationship with God that begins the moment we know Him. This transforms our understanding of eternity from something exclusively future to a present reality we begin participating in now.* [2 Corinthians 4:16-18:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/4/2-Corinthians-4-16.html) *Paul contrasts our momentary troubles with eternal glory, teaching us to fix our eyes on what is unseen rather than what is seen. This perspective helps us recognize how our present circumstances connect to eternal outcomes, changing how we evaluate daily experiences.*

7. **How does my understanding of Heaven influence my earthly investments?** [Matthew 6:19-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) *Jesus teaches that where our treasure is, there our heart will be also. This fundamental principle connects our material investments to our spiritual priorities, suggesting that how we allocate resources reveals what we truly value and believe about eternal reality.* [Hebrews 11:13-16:](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-13.html) *The heroes of faith acknowledged they were strangers and exiles on earth, seeking a better country—a heavenly one. Their example shows how heavenly citizenship should shape earthly decisions, causing us to hold temporal possessions loosely while investing in what lasts.*

8. **What eternal realities am I most prone to forget when making decisions?** [2 Corinthians 5:10:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-10.html) *Everyone must appear before Christ's judgment seat to receive what is due for things done in the body. This sobering reality of future accountability for present choices is easily forgotten in daily decision-making but provides crucial perspective on the eternal significance of seemingly small choices.* [Romans 14:10-12:](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/14/Romans-14-10.html) *Each of us will give an account of ourselves to God. Paul reminds believers that our choices and judgments will ultimately be evaluated by God, not by human standards, a truth that should inform our decision-making process.*

9. **How do I distinguish between good long-term thinking and truly eternal thinking?** [Luke 12:16-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-16.html) *In Jesus' parable of the rich fool, a man makes excellent long-term financial plans but is called a fool because he is not rich toward God. This parable powerfully distinguishes between prudent temporal planning and genuine eternal wisdom, showing how seemingly wise strategies can ultimately prove foolish if they neglect spiritual reality.* [1 Timothy 6:17-19:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-17.html) *Paul instructs the wealthy to be generous and willing to share, thus laying up treasure as a firm foundation for the coming age. This guidance helps distinguish between wise long-term financial thinking and truly eternal investment strategies.*

10. **What mental practices help me maintain an eternal perspective in temporal circumstances?** [Philippians 4:8:](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-8.html) *Paul directs believers to think about whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent or praiseworthy. This discipline of focused thought helps maintain eternal perspective amid temporal distractions by training our minds on transcendent values.* [Romans 12:2:](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html) *Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. This fundamental mental practice involves actively resisting worldly thought patterns while pursuing mental transformation through Scripture and the Holy Spirit's work.*

### Treasures in Heaven
11. **What does Jesus mean when He speaks of "storing up treasures in Heaven" in practical terms?** [Matthew 6:19-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) *Jesus contrasts earthly treasures that deteriorate with heavenly treasures that endure. While Jesus doesn't exhaustively define heavenly treasures, the broader context of His teachings suggests they include acts of obedience, generosity, self-sacrifice, and spiritual investments that have eternal significance rather than merely temporal value.* [Luke 12:33-34:](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-33.html) *Jesus connects selling possessions and giving to the poor with providing purses that will not wear out and treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted. This practical example shows how redirecting material resources toward kingdom purposes constitutes storing heavenly treasure.*

12. **How do I currently measure eternal return on investment versus worldly returns?** [Mark 8:36:](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-8-36.html) *Jesus asks what profit there is in gaining the whole world yet forfeiting one's soul. This profound question establishes the ultimate measure of return on investment—the eternal destiny of human souls, including our own—against which all worldly gains must be evaluated.* [Galatians 6:7-9:](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-7.html) *Paul explains the principle of sowing and reaping, noting that sowing to please the Spirit yields eternal life. This agricultural metaphor provides a framework for evaluating investments based on their ultimate harvest, distinguishing between temporary and eternal returns.*

13. **What specific actions or decisions might constitute "storing treasures in Heaven" in my context?** [Matthew 25:34-40:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-34.html) *Jesus identifies caring for the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, and imprisoned as actions with eternal significance. This teaching clarifies that meeting physical needs as an expression of love for Christ has eternal value.* [1 Timothy 6:17-19:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-17.html) *Paul instructs the wealthy to be rich in good deeds, generous and willing to share, thereby laying up treasure as a firm foundation for the coming age. These actions provide concrete examples of storing heavenly treasure through earthly resources.*

14. **How do I balance wise earthly stewardship with kingdom-focused investing?** [Matthew 25:14-30:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-14.html) *In the parable of the talents, Jesus affirms productive management of resources while emphasizing accountability to the Master. This teaching demonstrates that wise stewardship and kingdom-focus are complementary rather than contradictory, as faithful management ultimately serves kingdom purposes.* [1 Corinthians 4:2:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/4/1-Corinthians-4-2.html) *Those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. Paul emphasizes that Christian stewardship is fundamentally about faithfulness to God's purposes rather than maximizing returns by worldly standards.*

15. **What eternal treasures am I most motivated to pursue, and why?** [Philippians 3:7-11:](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-7.html) *Paul considers everything a loss compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ. This passionate declaration reveals Paul's highest treasure—intimate knowledge of Jesus—which motivated his entire ministry and provides a model for our own eternal pursuits.* [Revelation 4:10-11:](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-10.html) *The twenty-four elders cast their crowns before God's throne, declaring Him worthy of glory and honor. This heavenly scene suggests that the opportunity to worship and glorify God constitutes the highest treasure of eternity.*

16. **How might the concept of "rewards in Heaven" influence my earthly choices without becoming mercenary?** [1 Corinthians 3:10-15:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/3/1-Corinthians-3-10.html) *Paul describes how each person's work will be tested by fire, with lasting work rewarded. This teaching frames heavenly rewards not as mercenary compensation but as the natural fruit of faithful service, encouraging quality and integrity in all we do.* [Hebrews 11:24-26:](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-24.html) *Moses chose mistreatment with God's people over the treasures of Egypt because he was looking ahead to his reward. This example shows how eternal reward-consciousness can inspire sacrifice and faithful endurance rather than self-serving calculation.*

17. **What does Scripture reveal about the nature and substance of eternal rewards?** [2 Timothy 4:8:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-8.html) *Paul anticipates the crown of righteousness awarded by the righteous Judge to all who have longed for Christ's appearing. This reference to crowns suggests honor and recognition as aspects of heavenly rewards.* [Revelation 2:7, 10, 17, 26-28:](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/2/Revelation-2-7.html) *Christ promises various rewards to those who overcome, including access to the tree of life, the crown of life, hidden manna, a white stone with a new name, and authority over nations. These promises provide glimpses into the diverse and meaningful nature of eternal rewards.*

18. **How do I avoid turning eternal investment into a transaction or mere exchange?** [Luke 17:7-10:](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/17/Luke-17-7.html) *Jesus teaches that servants who have done everything commanded should consider themselves unworthy servants who have only done their duty. This perspective counters transactional thinking by emphasizing that our service to God flows from duty and relationship rather than calculation of benefits.* [1 John 4:19:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-19.html) *We love because He first loved us. This foundational principle reframes all spiritual investment as response to grace rather than transaction, grounding our motives in gratitude rather than self-interest.*

19. **What investments of time, talent, and treasure might yield the greatest eternal returns?** [Matthew 28:18-20:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-18.html) *Jesus commands making disciples of all nations. This Great Commission indicates that investments in evangelism and discipleship yield enormous eternal returns by expanding God's kingdom and transforming lives.* [Galatians 5:22-23:](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html) *The fruit of the Spirit represents lasting character qualities with eternal significance. Investing in spiritual formation produces character aligned with God's nature, constituting returns that transcend temporal circumstances.*

20. **How might my understanding of God's grace inform my pursuit of eternal treasures?** [Ephesians 2:8-10:](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html) *We are saved by grace through faith for good works prepared in advance for us to do. This comprehensive statement places grace as the foundation for all eternal pursuits, framing good works as response to salvation rather than means of earning it.* [Titus 2:11-14:](https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-11.html) *God's grace teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives. This passage shows how grace motivates and empowers our pursuit of eternal values rather than opposing effort.*

### Discipleship and Mentoring
21. **Who has made eternal investments in me, and how might I extend that legacy?** [2 Timothy 2:2:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/2/2-Timothy-2-2.html) *Paul instructs Timothy to entrust Paul's teachings to reliable people who will be qualified to teach others. This pattern of multi-generational spiritual investment creates an exponential legacy of faith transmission that each believer is called to continue.* [1 Corinthians 11:1:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/11/1-Corinthians-11-1.html) *Paul invites others to follow his example as he follows Christ's example. This transparent invitation to imitation demonstrates how personal example becomes a powerful form of legacy that others can extend.*

22. **What unique wisdom or experience do I have that should be intentionally passed on?** [Psalm 78:2-4:](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/78/Psalm-78-2.html) *The psalmist commits to teaching the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, His power, and the wonders He has done. This passage emphasizes our responsibility to pass on not just information but testimony of God's work in our lives and history.* [Deuteronomy 6:6-7:](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-6.html) *Moses commands Israel to impress God's commandments on their children, talking about them in all daily contexts. This comprehensive approach to transmission suggests wisdom should be woven into everyday conversations and experiences rather than isolated to formal teaching moments.*

23. **How do I identify those whom I should be actively discipling or mentoring?** [Matthew 9:36-38:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-36.html) *Jesus sees the crowds as harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd, and tells disciples to pray for workers for the harvest. This compassionate vision for humanity suggests we should identify discipleship candidates based on spiritual need rather than merely affinity or convenience.* [Acts 16:1-3:](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/16/Acts-16-1.html) *Paul meets Timothy, who was well spoken of by believers, and decides to take him along on his journey. This example shows how reputation, character, and community affirmation can help identify those ready for deeper investment.*

24. **What barriers prevent me from investing more deeply in the spiritual growth of others?** [Galatians 6:9:](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-9.html) *Paul encourages not growing weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. This exhortation acknowledges the fatigue and discouragement that can become barriers to sustained spiritual investment in others.* [2 Timothy 1:7:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-7.html) *God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power, love, and self-discipline. This verse addresses the fear that often prevents deeper investment in others, reminding us that God equips us with the necessary qualities for effective discipleship.*

25. **How might I better structure intentional discipleship relationships?** [Mark 3:14:](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/3/Mark-3-14.html) *Jesus appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach. This simple structure—being with Jesus and being sent by Jesus—provides a fundamental pattern for discipleship relationships that balance communion and mission.* [Acts 2:42-47:](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-42.html) *The early church devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer. This description outlines essential elements for structured discipleship communities: biblical teaching, relational connection, sacramental practice, and spiritual discipline.*

26. **What content or curriculum should form the foundation of my discipleship efforts?** [Matthew 28:20:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-20.html) *Jesus commands teaching disciples to obey everything He has commanded. This comprehensive scope establishes Jesus' teachings as the essential curriculum for all discipleship, focusing on obedience rather than merely information.* [Colossians 1:28-29:](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-28.html) *Paul proclaims Christ, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom to present everyone fully mature in Christ. This approach centers discipleship curriculum on the person of Christ rather than merely principles or practices.*

27. **How do I balance relationship building with intentional spiritual formation in mentoring?** [1 Thessalonians 2:7-8:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/2/1-Thessalonians-2-7.html) *Paul describes being gentle like a nursing mother, sharing not only the gospel but his life as well. This intimate imagery illustrates how authentic relationship creates the context for effective spiritual formation rather than competing with it.* [Philippians 4:9:](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-9.html) *Paul instructs believers to put into practice whatever they have learned, received, heard, or seen in him. This holistic approach integrates teaching with modeling, formal instruction with lived example.*

28. **What personal experiences might best serve others if vulnerably shared?** [2 Corinthians 1:3-7:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/1/2-Corinthians-1-3.html) *Paul explains how God comforts us in our troubles so that we can comfort others with the comfort we've received. This principle suggests that our personal struggles, when processed with God, become valuable resources for ministering to others facing similar challenges.* [Galatians 2:11-14:](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/2/Galatians-2-11.html) *Paul publicly confronts Peter's hypocrisy. This uncomfortable incident, which Paul later shares, demonstrates how even our failures and corrections can become instructive for others when vulnerably acknowledged.*

The physical Earth itself is also temporary, since our Creator will instantiate a new Earth as Christians know from [Revelation 21—22](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-22.html). As a result, the desires of this world are certainly temporary. Wise people resist these temporary, evil desires, following the example of Jesus.* [2 Peter 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/2-peter/3/2-peter-3-8.html) *God is not bound by counting days from a human perspective.
